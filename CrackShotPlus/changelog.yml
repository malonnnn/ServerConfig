1.65

    Quick fix to weapons using energy

    Fixed null error in camera recoil in >1.11(I just guess this happend in >1.11 because in 1.12 this didn't happen)
    Added life steal
        Shooter is healed by percentage of final damage dealt to victim
        Supports variables(update_lore) and attachments also

1.63

    Added Suggest_Resource_Pack_On_Join in basic.yml (work as "true" or "false"(string))

1.62

    Added option Use_One_Line_For_Attachments for update lore

1.61

    Possible fix for nulls in WorldGuard flag addon plugin
        I hope it worked, I haven't been able to reproduce that null
        Also flag addon plugin doesn't no longer generate automatically if Generate_CrackShot_Flag_Addon is missing from file.yml

1.60

    Fixed shooter knockback on damage
    Added CrackShotFlagAddon.jar
        New flags for WorldGuard regions (weapon-shoot and weapon-break-blocks)
        Disabled_Regions module requires CrackShotFlagAddon also
        Incase you don't want CrackShotFlagAddon.jar to be generated into plugins folder then
            Go to file.yml and add "Generate_CrackShot_Flag_Addon" if it isn't there yet and put it to false
    Added End_Message for Delay_Bar
        Basically just sends the end message to chat instead of action bar, title or subtitle
        Also changed in Delay_Bar that if there is an active delay bar task going another can't activate
    Changed Generate_Resource_Pack
        Now if Generate_Resource_Pack is true then CrackShotPlus default resource pack will also be suggested on player join
        Will still generate CrackShotPlus_Resource_Pack.zip into CrackShotPlus folder

1.59

    Temporary turret fix and add
        Added way to choose what kind of particles spawn to temporary turret
        Fixed runnable not canceling and setting projectile to wrong weapon's projectile
    Added shooter knockback on damage
    Added Entity_Target_List and Entity_Target_Blacklist for homing projectiles
        Choose which entity types homing projectiles can chase or which entity types homing projectiles can't chase
    Added explode attachment
        Make weapon projectiles explode on impact with surface or player or both
    Added run command for shoot, reload and damage (+ headshot, backstab, critical hit)
        As attachment also
        Also added attachment run command for kill also
    Added potions affect for bullet spread, fire rate and damage (+ headshot, backstab, critical hit)

        Change fire rate while zooming
        Attachment support
    Added PlaceholderAPI support
        For every action bar, title and subtitle message
    Added way to split attachments to new lines
        Two simple things
            Maxium attachments per line to be changed and new line format
        Moved update lore to its own "category" so update lore is broken for every weapon (sorry and sorry no convert this time). It is quick to fix though
            Now instead of this
            Update_Lore:
            - "Some lore line"
            Its like this
            Note that Maxium_Attachments_Per_Line and New_Line_Format aren't must
                Recommended to use though incase you use #ATTACHMENTS# variable in your lore
            Update_Lore:
                Maxium_Attachments_Per_Line: Some integer
                New_Line_Format: "Some format"
                Lore:
                - "Some lore line"
    Added changelog into CrackShotPlus jar
        Kinda made it for me to remember what I have changed in some version, but decided to make it so you can also check it if you want to
        Incase you don't want changelog.yml to be generated into CrackShotPlus folder then
            Go to file.yml and add "Generate_Changelog" if it isn't there yet and put it to false
    Changed convert command
        Changed convert command to work simply like this /csp convert
    Fixed entity explode bug
        Since Break Block update(I think) this bug has existed, but just got report about it
        Any entity explode (ex. tnt, creepers) didn't affect anything and that is now fixed
        Luckily I got reported about this because its kinda huge bug. Thanks for reporting!
        
1.58

    This version may contain bugs because I changed pretty many things in code especially those things which used IDs may have bugs, but at least so far I haven't found one
    Removed IDs from CrackShotPlus
        Made this change simple for you
            Simply use /csp convert command
            It converts IDs in files in selected folders to material so it will work in CrackShotPlus
                Example usage /csp convert weapons,attachments,skins
                Another example usage /csp convert skins
    Added Temporary_Turrets
    Added Projectile_Turn_Ratio for homing projectiles
    Added Non_Increasing_Circle for energy trails
    Added way to use newer particles

1.57

    Fixed break blocks second data value. Sorry

    In next update 1.58 I need to make few changes
        Item ID is getting removed
            Configurations will need some changes because ID like 20 doesn't work anymore and it will need to be changed to GLASS for example
        I will add option to use particle instead of effect in 1.9+ servers
            Will make optional if someone doesn't want to use particles
            Using particle you can use newest "trails"

1.56


    In next update (1.57) (due to Minecraft 1.13)
        Item ID is getting removed so pretty many things in CrackShotPlus are going to break
        Configurations will need changes
            You can no longer use item ID like 20, you need to use it like GLASS
    Break_Blocks
        Blacklist works for explosions also
        Chest content, sign letters etc. will be regenerated also
        Decreased chance for blocks like sand, torches, rails, carpets etc. disappear (disappearing isn't still 0%, just decreased the chance)
        Added maxium amount of blocks that can regen per update
        Way to stall the regeneration if player is inside regeneration area
            Recommended to add these in extra.yml or regenerate it
            Break_Blocks_Max_Blocks_Generated_Once_Per_Update: 100

            # This one has to be in brackets (")
            # "true" or "false"
            Break_Blocks_No_Generation_If_Player_Inside: "false"
            
1.55


    Fixed trail catch
        Now catches incase it hits block or damages player to their location
        Tell me if this causes new bugs so I can fix
    Added old pumpkin on zoom system (new one is used by default)
        Incase you don't want for some reason use packets to use pumpkin on zoom you can use old way by doing this
            Go to CrackShotPlus folder -> otherconfig -> extra.yml -> change
            # This one has to be in brackets (")
            # "true" or "false"
            Use_Old_Pumpkin_On_Zoom_System: "false"
            To this
            # This one has to be in brackets (")
            # "true" or "false"
            Use_Old_Pumpkin_On_Zoom_System: "true"

1.54

    Fixed holograms not despawning in unloaded chunks(I think)
    Changed Copy Weapon To Off Hand to work with packets
        This fixes the weapon drop on death also

1.53

    Fixed startup in China
    Im still investigating the pumpkin disappearing after sniper shot
        This doesn't happen to me for some reason
        I need weapon's configuration where pumpkin disappears after shot!

1.52


    Fixed pumpkin on zoom in 1.8 versions.
    Added #CAMERA_RECOIL_SIDEWAYS# & #CAMERA_RECOIL_UPWARDS# variables
    Added CAMERA_RECOIL attachment

1.51


    Added camera recoil
    Added options to choose bar style & color for killfeed
    Added file.yml to be able to choose which folders you want generated
    Added Disable_Gun_Placing_To_Off_Hand into extra.yml. Can be used to fix bugs in CrackShot & offhand problems.
    Changed Pumpkin On Zoom to work client-sided. This may cause bugs, but I need you guys to notify me about them!
        Other people wont see pumpkin in players head anymore, only player who has it
        If player has helmet it is now effective even if player has pumpkin head from zoom
        Removed pumpkin changes from CrackShotPlus resource pack due to they wasn't no longer need because Pumpkin On Zoom is now client-sided.

1.50

    Fixed bullet drop in 1.12
    Changed skin & attachment all inventory to 54 slots
    Few API methods
        getAttachmentsForWeapon(String WeaponTitle)
        getRandomAttachmentForWeapon(String WeaponTitle, Random Random)
        getSkinsForWeapon(String weaponName)
        getRandomSkinForWeapon(String WeaponTitle, Random Random)

1.49

        Players can now shoot even while driving and having CrackShotPlus installed

    Added new API method setWeaponAmmoAmount()
    Added way to run commands when killing victim
        Run command as console, victim or killer
        Check this here

1.47

    Kill event now works for grenades also.
        This means that killfeed works now for grenades also.

1.46


    Added new event WeaponPickupEvent
    Added new command to take every weapon using only one command
        You can also take all skins at the same time
            Try /csp command to see how it works
    Resource pack
        @NullBlox corrected durability calculations. Fixed stone sword texture
        You might want to update your resource pack
    Fixed bug which was caused by CSP's CS recipe handling
    Changed permissions to work like in CrackShot.
        This means that some permissions are now granted by default for everyone(can be negated though)
            Take a look into this.

1.45

    Fixed typo in Grenade Launcher
    Added new folder into CrackShotPlus folder called "weaponsrecipes" just to clearify usage of it.
        You need to let CrackShotPlus handle CrackShot weapon crafting since 1.12 because of one error in CrackShot
    Resource pack changes
        AK-47 now fits better in item frames
        @NullBlox also did some nice cleanups to CrackShotPlus resource pack

1.44

    I have fixed recipe unregistering in CrackShotPlus, but into CrackShot I can't fix it so I made alternative way to make CrackShot weapon crafting. In 1.12 CrackShot crafting is broken so don't use it(or actually just recipe unregistering).
        Example how to use this alternative, just add this kind of thing into any folder of CrackShotPlus and change things as you want to. If you use Weapon_Name don't use that "Item" section as you have used to.
        test:
            Weapon_Name: "AK-47_CSP"
            Crafting:
                Amount: 1
                Shaped_Recipe: false
                Recipe: "280,289,289"
        Basically I added that "Weapon_Name" so you can make crafting recipes for any CrackShot weapon.

1.43

    Added 1.12 support
    
1.42

    Fixed few little bugs
    Removed delayed durability changing due to being unused and causing lot of bugs

1.41


    Improved variables performance in update lore
    Changed variables;
        You can now choose NUMBER, BAR or PERCENTAGE
        In each expect NUMBER you'll have to define minium and maxium that thing can be
            Take examples from updated default weapons
                You can update them by deleting old ones

1.40

    Skins, attachments, trails & visual reloads in lore will now use Item_Name player used to add it.

1.39

    Fixed shooting after putting weapon to itemframe
    Fixed ammo removing bug

1.38

    Recoded 1.9 & 1.10 projectile bug fix. Just install this version and it will be automatically enabled.
    Hopefully fixed csp item list error(?)

1.37

    Added Custom Hit Block Sound
    
1.36

    Added new command to get CrackShotPlus's items.
    I added these commands quickly because I have to pack stuff.
        /csp item list
        /csp item get (item)
        /csp item give (item) (player)
    Ill be back at monday, but just to let everyone know I have lot of things happening in IRL so I have had to keep coding at second place for a while and Im really sorry for that!

1.35

    Added bossbar killfeed (1.9 and above)
    Updated resource pack to hide killfeed's bossbar to make it look cooler
        Wither's & enderdragon's bossbar works still
    Fixed few bugs

1.34

    Fixed bouncing projectiles
    Fixed attachment all command
    Removed debug message

1.33

    This update fixed compatibility issue with 1.8
    
1.32

    Added smoke grenade
    Added Trail_Catch for projectile trails
    Added Circle trail type for energy trails
    Added way to choose commands yourself.
        Take a look into /plugins/CrackShotPlus/otherconfig/commands.yml
    Fixed bug with block regeneration
    Fixed ammo removing permission(I had typo).
    Attachments can now have Durability and Change_Item_Type
        If using those don't let players use actual skins, just choose default skin using Default_Skin
        Suggested to only let weapon have one attachment which can change durability or item type to not have any conflicts(use Attachments_Which_Denies)
        Example where after player adds silencer to weapon its durability is changed to 1 and item type to 275;
        Silencer:
            Durability: 1
            Change_Item_Type: "275"
            Silencer:
                Hide_Trails: true
                Reduce_Sound_Volume: 0.5
                Reduce_Damage: 3.0
                Multiply_Projectile_Speed: -0.3
            Crafting:
                Amount: 1
                Shaped_Recipe: true
                Recipe: "113,113,113,113,112,113,113,113,113"
            Item:
                Item_Type: "359"
                Item_Name: "&cSilencer"
                Item_Lore:
                - "&7Stats&c:"
                - "&c- &7Hides trails &c- &7TRUE"
                - "&c- &7Reduced sound volume &c- &70.5"
                - "&c- &7Reduces damage &c- &73.0"
                - "&c- &7Reduces projectile speed &c- &70.3"

1.31

    Fixed null in inventory click

    Require Both Hands to shoot
    Copy Weapon To Off Hand on held

            In order to use these make sure your extra.yml has em.
            Shooting_Cooldown_On_Change_Held_Slot:
                Enable: false
                Cooldown: 60
                Message: "&7You can not shoot yet!"
            Break_Blocks_Update_Interval: 40
            Break_Blocks_Bypass_Regions: true
            Disable_Shooting_While_In_Spectator_Mode: true
            # 1.9 projectile bug in collision at close range.
            # This bug got fixed by Spigot in 1.11, but incase you don't want to update to 1.11 put this true.
            Fix_Projectile_Bug: false

1.29

    Fixed when attachment were detached or added and CSP took each attachment from slot when it should've only taken one.

1.28

    Attachments
        Added "Maxium_Stack_Amount"
            Used to stack exactly same attachment

    Rewrote some wiki.
        Should be now more organized
    Added disabled regions node to disable weapons in certain WorldGuard regions
    I found a simple way to change weapon item type on skin change and keep weapon working
        Basically what this means
            You can now organize your skins really easily and well
                Id recommend to check new default weapons & default resource pack after updating
            Skins can be used in 1.8 also now, just use Change_Item_Type in skins

1.25

    Fixed that permissions didn't work with some plugins
    Added way to let break blocks bypass region check
        In order to use this go to otherconfig folder -> extra.yml -> add "Break_Blocks_Bypass_Regions: true" there.

1.05

    Id call this version stable V2, but I have still left to do following things;
        Rewrite wiki (70% done)
            V1 wiki will stay if someone doesn't want to move to V2.
        Hunting weapon (need to wait one texture for it before doing it)
        There is also things I was going to add into V2, but im adding new features constantly so they will be in CSP sooner or later
    If you were using using 1.04 before add these things into your config.yml:
        No_Attachments_On_Lore_Update: "&7No attachments"
        No_Skin_On_Lore_Update: "&7No skin"
        No_Visual_Reload_On_Lore_Update: "&7No visual reload"
        No_Trail_On_Lore_Update: "&7No trail"
        No_StatTrak_On_Lore_Update: "&70"
        Else if you were using 1.03 or version before that delete your configurations
    There is still modules.yml temporarily.
    Added in #5:
        Break block's explosions are now spheres
        Break blocks now supports terrain protection plugins such as WorldGuard
        Update lore now supports skins, attachments, trails, visual reloads and StatTrak points.
        Fixed bugs.
        Something I don't remember.
        Im aware that skins doesn't work in 1.11. Im going to fix this as soon as possible.

1.01

    CrackShotPlus V2
        CSP has been fully recoded
    Commands you can see by typing /csp
    CSP generates modules.yml where is listed each module from CSP currently.
    This version breaks everything from 0.49 version and below
    There is many things to add still...
    This version works only with 1.10.
    This version doesn't have any preconfigured weapons!

Go ahead and test CSP V2 and report bugs for me. Since there isn't documentation yet, you can just ask in discussions if you need help in V2 configurationing.
