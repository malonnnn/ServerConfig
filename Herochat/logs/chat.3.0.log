2017.01.28 19:03:33 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop
2017.01.28 19:03:36 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/You know the place
2017.01.28 19:03:36 G/greenfield/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/For killing a mortal as a hero
2017.01.28 19:03:39 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy
2017.01.28 19:03:42 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
2017.01.28 19:03:45 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast
2017.01.28 19:03:47 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Awww - Big bowl of sauerkraut
2017.01.28 19:03:49 G/survival/Harley Quinn/S_HarleyQuinn_S/...

2017.01.28 19:03:52 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/It was driving me crazy
2017.01.28 19:03:54 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said to my mom
2017.01.28 19:03:55 G/greenfield/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/The day I first met you
2017.01.28 19:03:57 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "Hey, mom, what's with all the sauerkraut?"
2017.01.28 19:03:57 G/greenfield/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/You told me
2017.01.28 19:04:00 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And my dear, sweet mother
2017.01.28 19:04:01 G/greenfield/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/You'd never fall in love
2017.01.28 19:04:02 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train
2017.01.28 19:04:05 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And she leaned right down next to me
2017.01.28 19:04:06 G/survival/Harley Quinn/S_HarleyQuinn_S/D:

2017.01.28 19:04:11 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
2017.01.28 19:04:14 G/greenfield/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/I know fear is what it really was
2017.01.28 19:04:14 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
2017.01.28 19:04:16 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's when I swore that someday
2017.01.28 19:04:18 G/greenfield/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/Now here we are,

2017.01.28 19:04:31 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel

2017.01.28 19:15:13 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old

2017.01.28 19:15:35 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore

2017.01.28 19:15:36 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 19:15:37 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 19:15:38 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 19:15:39 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Except for me

2017.01.28 19:15:55 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 19:15:55 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/It's OK, they're clean
2017.01.28 19:15:55 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C

2017.01.28 19:15:56 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I turned on the SpectraVision
2017.01.28 19:15:57 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
2017.01.28 19:15:59 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 19:15:59 G/greenfield/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/COOL FOR THE SUMMER
2017.01.28 19:15:59 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well now, who could that be?
2017.01.28 19:16:00 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 19:16:00 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/No answer

2017.01.28 19:16:04 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 19:16:05 G/survival/Darkseid/Pokepug123/me take nothing but now me go minening
2017.01.28 19:16:05 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
2017.01.28 19:16:06 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 19:16:07 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 19:16:08 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I'm like "Hey, you can't have that"
2017.01.28 19:16:09 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 19:16:10 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And he's like "Tough"
2017.01.28 19:16:10 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 19:16:11 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 19:16:11 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 19:16:12 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 19:16:14 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 19:16:15 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
2017.01.28 19:16:16 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Yes indeed, you better believe it
2017.01.28 19:16:17 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
2017.01.28 19:16:18 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice
2017.01.28 19:16:19 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And you know what it said?
2017.01.28 19:16:19 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I'll tell you what it said
2017.01.28 19:16:20 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/It said

2017.01.28 19:16:26 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
2017.01.28 19:16:28 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
2017.01.28 19:16:29 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice

2017.01.28 19:16:49 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 19:16:50 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 19:16:51 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/(rabid gnawing sounds)

2017.01.28 19:17:06 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
2017.01.28 19:17:07 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 19:17:08 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 19:17:09 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 19:17:10 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/We were inseparable after that
2017.01.28 19:17:10 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 19:17:12 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 19:17:12 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 19:17:13 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So we got married and we bought us a house
2017.01.28 19:17:14 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly

2017.01.28 19:17:18 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She said "Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?"
2017.01.28 19:17:18 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "Woah, hold on now, baby"
2017.01.28 19:17:19 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment"
2017.01.28 19:17:20 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So we broke up and I never saw her again
2017.01.28 19:17:21 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But that's just the way things go

2017.01.28 19:17:24 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
2017.01.28 19:17:25 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 19:17:27 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face
2017.01.28 19:17:28 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
2017.01.28 19:17:28 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I was gettin' a lot of attitude
2017.01.28 19:17:29 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 19:17:30 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 19:17:32 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself

2017.01.28 19:17:35 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"
2017.01.28 19:17:36 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So I did
2017.01.28 19:17:37 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And then he gets all indignant on me
2017.01.28 19:17:38 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 19:17:38 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, that's just great

2017.01.28 19:17:43 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
2017.01.28 19:17:44 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
2017.01.28 19:17:45 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 19:17:46 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
2017.01.28 19:17:47 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 19:17:48 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 19:17:50 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 19:17:50 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/(screaming sounds)
2017.01.28 19:17:51 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 19:17:52 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?
2017.01.28 19:17:53 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 19:17:54 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Kinda lost my train of thought
2017.01.28 19:17:54 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 19:17:56 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it

2017.01.28 19:18:01 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Full of loathing and self-doubt
2017.01.28 19:18:02 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
2017.01.28 19:18:03 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that

2017.01.28 20:17:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We were inseparable after that
2017.01.28 20:17:48 _V_Anchovii_V_ -> GalaxehPanda: on our favorite rocket shi;p
2017.01.28 20:17:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:17:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 20:17:49 G/greenfield/Sentry/Boofurd/and also I cant have it
2017.01.28 20:17:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we got married and we bought us a house

2017.01.28 20:17:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah
2017.01.28 20:17:49 G/survival/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/dude
2017.01.28 20:17:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
2017.01.28 20:17:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Woah, hold on now, baby"
2017.01.28 20:17:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment"
2017.01.28 20:17:50 _V_Anchovii_V_ -> GalaxehPanda: WE ARE GOING ON A TRIP
2017.01.28 20:17:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But that's just the way things go
2017.01.28 20:17:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:17:51 _V_Anchovii_V_ -> GalaxehPanda: on our favorite rocket shi;p
2017.01.28 20:17:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
2017.01.28 20:17:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
2017.01.28 20:17:52 _V_Anchovii_V_ -> GalaxehPanda: WE ARE GOING ON A TRIP
2017.01.28 20:17:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face
2017.01.28 20:17:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
2017.01.28 20:17:52 _V_Anchovii_V_ -> GalaxehPanda: on our favorite rocket shi;p
2017.01.28 20:17:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was gettin' a lot of attitude
2017.01.28 20:17:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 20:17:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:17:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:17:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I, I say to him, I say "Hey, you want me to help you with that?"
2017.01.28 20:17:54 G/greenfield/Sentry/Boofurd/unless she says I can
2017.01.28 20:17:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:17:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"
2017.01.28 20:17:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I did
2017.01.28 20:17:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then he gets all indignant on me
2017.01.28 20:17:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:17:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: How was I supposed to know that?
2017.01.28 20:17:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
2017.01.28 20:17:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So what's he complaining about?
2017.01.28 20:17:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
2017.01.28 20:17:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
2017.01.28 20:17:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:17:57 G/survival/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/why must you telll us that?
2017.01.28 20:17:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
2017.01.28 20:17:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:17:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 20:17:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (screaming sounds)
2017.01.28 20:17:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?
2017.01.28 20:17:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 20:17:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 20:17:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
2017.01.28 20:17:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I hate sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:18:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's all I'm really tryin' to say
2017.01.28 20:18:00 _V_Anchovii_V_ -> GalaxehPanda: xD
2017.01.28 20:18:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
2017.01.28 20:18:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And find yourself in an existential quandary
2017.01.28 20:18:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Full of loathing and self-doubt
2017.01.28 20:18:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
2017.01.28 20:18:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
2017.01.28 20:18:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours
2017.01.28 20:18:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's still a little place called

2017.01.28 20:18:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy
2017.01.28 20:18:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast
2017.01.28 20:18:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Awww - Big bowl of sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:18:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Every single morning
2017.01.28 20:18:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It was driving me crazy
2017.01.28 20:18:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said to my mom
2017.01.28 20:18:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my dear, sweet mother
2017.01.28 20:18:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train
2017.01.28 20:18:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she leaned right down next to me
2017.01.28 20:18:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
2017.01.28 20:18:09 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/ARE U DONE SINGING
2017.01.28 20:18:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
2017.01.28 20:18:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I swore that someday
2017.01.28 20:18:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
2017.01.28 20:18:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
2017.01.28 20:18:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
2017.01.28 20:18:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel
2017.01.28 20:18:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
2017.01.28 20:18:11 GalaxehPanda -> Angel__Boy: ARWE U DONE
2017.01.28 20:18:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
2017.01.28 20:18:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
2017.01.28 20:18:11 G/greenfield/Sentry/Boofurd/yes
2017.01.28 20:18:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
2017.01.28 20:18:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, a first class one-way ticket to
2017.01.28 20:18:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh yeah

2017.01.28 20:18:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
2017.01.28 20:18:13 G/greenfield/Sentry/Boofurd/lol
2017.01.28 20:18:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
2017.01.28 20:18:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
2017.01.28 20:18:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:18:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
2017.01.28 20:18:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 20:18:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:18:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:18:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except for me
2017.01.28 20:18:15 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/O GAWD
2017.01.28 20:18:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know why?
2017.01.28 20:18:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: 'Cause I had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:18:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:18:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:18:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:18:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:18:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha ha
2017.01.28 20:18:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha
2017.01.28 20:18:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah
2017.01.28 20:18:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:18:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
2017.01.28 20:18:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:18:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
2017.01.28 20:18:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:18:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 20:18:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's OK, they're clean
2017.01.28 20:18:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
2017.01.28 20:18:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I turned on the SpectraVision
2017.01.28 20:18:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
2017.01.28 20:18:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 20:18:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well now, who could that be?
2017.01.28 20:18:20 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/HE TYPES SO FAST
2017.01.28 20:18:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:18:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No answer
2017.01.28 20:18:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's no answer
2017.01.28 20:18:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "WHO IS IT?"
2017.01.28 20:18:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 20:18:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
2017.01.28 20:18:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 20:18:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 20:18:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, you can't have that"
2017.01.28 20:18:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 20:18:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 20:18:24 G/greenfield/Sentry/Boofurd/wb
2017.01.28 20:18:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:18:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:18:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 20:18:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Yes indeed, you better believe it
2017.01.28 20:18:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
2017.01.28 20:18:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you know what it said?
2017.01.28 20:18:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll tell you what it said
2017.01.28 20:18:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:18:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:18:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:18:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:18:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:28 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:28 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
2017.01.28 20:18:28 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice
2017.01.28 20:18:29 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/;-;
2017.01.28 20:18:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop
2017.01.28 20:18:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
2017.01.28 20:18:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any glazed donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:18:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta glazed donuts"
2017.01.28 20:18:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, you got any jelly donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:18:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta jelly donuts"
2017.01.28 20:18:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?"

2017.01.28 20:18:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts"
2017.01.28 20:18:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta cinnamon rolls"
2017.01.28 20:18:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any apple fritters?"
2017.01.28 20:18:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any bear claws?"
2017.01.28 20:18:32 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/Angel*
2017.01.28 20:18:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "Wait a minute, I'll go check"
2017.01.28 20:18:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"
2017.01.28 20:18:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He says "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"
2017.01.28 20:18:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:18:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 20:18:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (rabid gnawing sounds)
2017.01.28 20:18:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, they were just going nuts
2017.01.28 20:18:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They were tearin' me apart
2017.01.28 20:18:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head"
2017.01.28 20:18:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I believe it went a little something like this . . .
2017.01.28 20:18:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Doh

2017.01.28 20:18:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah, (more screaming)
2017.01.28 20:18:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
2017.01.28 20:18:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'
2017.01.28 20:18:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Like a constipated weiner dog
2017.01.28 20:18:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams

2017.01.28 20:18:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 20:18:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:18:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:18:39 G/survival/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/-3-
2017.01.28 20:18:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We were inseparable after that
2017.01.28 20:18:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 20:18:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:18:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we got married and we bought us a house
2017.01.28 20:18:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
2017.01.28 20:18:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
2017.01.28 20:18:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?"
2017.01.28 20:18:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Woah, hold on now, baby"
2017.01.28 20:18:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment"
2017.01.28 20:18:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we broke up and I never saw her again
2017.01.28 20:18:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But that's just the way things go
2017.01.28 20:18:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
2017.01.28 20:18:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
2017.01.28 20:18:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 20:18:43 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/The chat is too pink and bright
2017.01.28 20:18:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face
2017.01.28 20:18:44 G/greenfield/Sentry/Boofurd/_V_Anchovii_V_
2017.01.28 20:18:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was gettin' a lot of attitude
2017.01.28 20:18:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 20:18:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:18:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I, I say to him, I say "Hey, you want me to help you with that?"
2017.01.28 20:18:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:18:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"
2017.01.28 20:18:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I did
2017.01.28 20:18:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then he gets all indignant on me
2017.01.28 20:18:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, that's just great
2017.01.28 20:18:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: How was I supposed to know that?
2017.01.28 20:18:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
2017.01.28 20:18:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:18:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So what's he complaining about?
2017.01.28 20:18:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
2017.01.28 20:18:48 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/yes?
2017.01.28 20:18:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:18:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:18:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 20:18:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 20:18:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (screaming sounds)
2017.01.28 20:18:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 20:18:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?
2017.01.28 20:18:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Kinda lost my train of thought
2017.01.28 20:18:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 20:18:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
2017.01.28 20:18:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is
2017.01.28 20:18:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I hate sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:18:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
2017.01.28 20:18:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And find yourself in an existential quandary
2017.01.28 20:18:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
2017.01.28 20:18:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
2017.01.28 20:18:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's still a little place called
2017.01.28 20:18:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque

2017.01.28 20:18:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "U" (U)
2017.01.28 20:18:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "querque" (querque)
2017.01.28 20:18:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:18:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop
2017.01.28 20:18:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know the place
2017.01.28 20:18:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy
2017.01.28 20:18:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
2017.01.28 20:18:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast
2017.01.28 20:18:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Every single morning
2017.01.28 20:18:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It was driving me crazy
2017.01.28 20:18:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Hey, mom, what's with all the sauerkraut?"
2017.01.28 20:18:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my dear, sweet mother
2017.01.28 20:18:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train
2017.01.28 20:18:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she leaned right down next to me
2017.01.28 20:19:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she said "IT'S GOOD FOR YOU"
2017.01.28 20:19:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
2017.01.28 20:19:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
2017.01.28 20:19:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I swore that someday
2017.01.28 20:19:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
2017.01.28 20:19:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
2017.01.28 20:19:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:19:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
2017.01.28 20:19:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wacka wacka doodoo yeah
2017.01.28 20:19:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
2017.01.28 20:19:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
2017.01.28 20:19:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
2017.01.28 20:19:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, a first class one-way ticket to
2017.01.28 20:19:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:19:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:19:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh yeah
2017.01.28 20:19:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
2017.01.28 20:19:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
2017.01.28 20:19:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
2017.01.28 20:19:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
2017.01.28 20:19:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:19:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
2017.01.28 20:19:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 20:19:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:19:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:19:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know why?
2017.01.28 20:19:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: 'Cause I had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:19:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:19:07 G/greenfield/Sentry/Boofurd/if you would like trigon to have gmc, you can msg me a photo of him creating matter from nothing
2017.01.28 20:19:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:19:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:19:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:19:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha ha
2017.01.28 20:19:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha
2017.01.28 20:19:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah
2017.01.28 20:19:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
2017.01.28 20:19:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:19:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
2017.01.28 20:19:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:19:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:19:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 20:19:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
2017.01.28 20:19:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I turned on the SpectraVision
2017.01.28 20:19:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 20:19:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well now, who could that be?
2017.01.28 20:19:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:19:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No answer
2017.01.28 20:19:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:19:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's no answer
2017.01.28 20:19:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They're not sayin' anything
2017.01.28 20:19:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 20:19:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 20:19:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 20:19:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 20:19:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Tough"
2017.01.28 20:19:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 20:19:15 G/greenfield/Sentry/Boofurd/because here powers are based off feats
2017.01.28 20:19:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:19:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 20:19:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:19:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 20:19:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
2017.01.28 20:19:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Yes indeed, you better believe it
2017.01.28 20:19:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
2017.01.28 20:19:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice

2017.01.28 20:21:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
2017.01.28 20:21:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:21:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
2017.01.28 20:21:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:21:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:21:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except for me
2017.01.28 20:21:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: 'Cause I had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:21:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:21:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:21:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up

2017.01.28 20:21:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha ha
2017.01.28 20:21:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah
2017.01.28 20:21:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
2017.01.28 20:21:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:21:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
2017.01.28 20:21:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:21:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
2017.01.28 20:21:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:21:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 20:21:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's OK, they're clean
2017.01.28 20:21:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
2017.01.28 20:21:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
2017.01.28 20:21:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 20:21:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well now, who could that be?
2017.01.28 20:21:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:21:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No answer
2017.01.28 20:21:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:21:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's no answer
2017.01.28 20:21:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They're not sayin' anything
2017.01.28 20:21:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 20:21:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
2017.01.28 20:21:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 20:21:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, you can't have that"
2017.01.28 20:21:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 20:21:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 20:21:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:21:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 20:21:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 20:21:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
2017.01.28 20:21:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Yes indeed, you better believe it
2017.01.28 20:21:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice
2017.01.28 20:21:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you know what it said?
2017.01.28 20:21:59 GalaxehPanda -> Angel__Boy: Stup it Uncle Woy xD
2017.01.28 20:21:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll tell you what it said

2017.01.28 20:22:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:22:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:22:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:22:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque

2017.01.28 20:22:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
2017.01.28 20:22:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
2017.01.28 20:22:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice
2017.01.28 20:22:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But first, I decided to buy some donuts

2017.01.28 20:22:03 GalaxehPanda -> Angel__Boy: Stup it Uncle Woy xD
2017.01.28 20:22:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any cinnamon rolls?"

2017.01.28 20:22:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any apple fritters?"
2017.01.28 20:22:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta apple fritters"
2017.01.28 20:22:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "Wait a minute, I'll go check"
2017.01.28 20:22:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, we're outta bear claws"
2017.01.28 20:22:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"
2017.01.28 20:22:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "OK, I'll take that"
2017.01.28 20:22:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:22:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 20:22:05 G/survival/Zoom/BubbaTruk/to give me materials
2017.01.28 20:22:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (rabid gnawing sounds)

2017.01.28 20:22:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They were tearin' me apart
2017.01.28 20:22:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head"
2017.01.28 20:22:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Doh

2017.01.28 20:22:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
2017.01.28 20:22:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'
2017.01.28 20:22:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Like a constipated weiner dog
2017.01.28 20:22:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
2017.01.28 20:22:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Her name was Zelda
2017.01.28 20:22:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
2017.01.28 20:22:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:22:09 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/;-;
2017.01.28 20:22:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:22:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We were inseparable after that
2017.01.28 20:22:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:22:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 20:22:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we got married and we bought us a house
2017.01.28 20:22:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
2017.01.28 20:22:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah
2017.01.28 20:22:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
2017.01.28 20:22:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?"
2017.01.28 20:22:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment"
2017.01.28 20:22:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we broke up and I never saw her again
2017.01.28 20:22:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But that's just the way things go
2017.01.28 20:22:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:22:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
2017.01.28 20:22:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
2017.01.28 20:22:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face
2017.01.28 20:22:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
2017.01.28 20:22:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was gettin' a lot of attitude
2017.01.28 20:22:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:22:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:22:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I, I say to him, I say "Hey, you want me to help you with that?"
2017.01.28 20:22:14 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/SPEAK IN GLOBAL UNCLE WOY
2017.01.28 20:22:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"
2017.01.28 20:22:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I did
2017.01.28 20:22:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then he gets all indignant on me
2017.01.28 20:22:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:22:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, that's just great
2017.01.28 20:22:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: How was I supposed to know that?
2017.01.28 20:22:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
2017.01.28 20:22:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:22:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So what's he complaining about?
2017.01.28 20:22:16 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/NOT IN MSG
2017.01.28 20:22:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
2017.01.28 20:22:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
2017.01.28 20:22:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
2017.01.28 20:22:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:22:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 20:22:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (screaming sounds)
2017.01.28 20:22:18 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/PWS
2017.01.28 20:22:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 20:22:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?
2017.01.28 20:22:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Kinda lost my train of thought
2017.01.28 20:22:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 20:22:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
2017.01.28 20:22:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is
2017.01.28 20:22:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I hate sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:22:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's all I'm really tryin' to say
2017.01.28 20:22:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
2017.01.28 20:22:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Full of loathing and self-doubt
2017.01.28 20:22:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
2017.01.28 20:22:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
2017.01.28 20:22:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's still a little place called
2017.01.28 20:22:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque

2017.01.28 20:22:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Every single morning
2017.01.28 20:22:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It was driving me crazy

2017.01.28 20:22:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she said "IT'S GOOD FOR YOU"
2017.01.28 20:22:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth

2017.01.28 20:22:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:22:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
2017.01.28 20:22:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:22:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:22:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except for me
2017.01.28 20:22:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: 'Cause I had my tray table up

2017.01.28 20:22:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
2017.01.28 20:22:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:22:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
2017.01.28 20:22:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:22:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
2017.01.28 20:22:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna

2017.01.28 20:22:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well now, who could that be?
2017.01.28 20:22:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No answer

2017.01.28 20:22:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 20:22:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
2017.01.28 20:22:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 20:22:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 20:22:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, you can't have that"
2017.01.28 20:22:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 20:22:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 20:22:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:22:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 20:22:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:22:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 20:22:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
2017.01.28 20:22:44 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/thats why he is doing this
2017.01.28 20:22:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Yes indeed, you better believe it

2017.01.28 20:23:43 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:23:43 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/How was I supposed to know that?

2017.01.28 20:23:54 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And my dear, sweet mother
2017.01.28 20:23:54 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train

2017.01.28 20:23:59 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:23:59 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died

2017.01.28 20:24:11 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
2017.01.28 20:24:11 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And he says "Yeah, what do ya want?"
2017.01.28 20:24:11 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "You got any glazed donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:24:11 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He said "No, we're outta glazed donuts"
2017.01.28 20:24:11 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "Well, you got any jelly donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:24:12 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He said "No, we're outta jelly donuts"
2017.01.28 20:24:12 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:24:12 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "You got any cinnamon rolls?"
2017.01.28 20:24:12 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He said "No, we're outta cinnamon rolls"
2017.01.28 20:24:13 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "You got any apple fritters?"
2017.01.28 20:24:13 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He said "No, we're outta apple fritters"
2017.01.28 20:24:13 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "You got any bear claws?"
2017.01.28 20:24:13 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He said "Wait a minute, I'll go check"
2017.01.28 20:24:13 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"No, we're outta bear claws"
2017.01.28 20:24:13 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"
2017.01.28 20:24:14 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He says "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"
2017.01.28 20:24:14 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/THAN THE SUN
2017.01.28 20:24:14 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "OK, I'll take that"
2017.01.28 20:24:14 G/survival/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/WHY
2017.01.28 20:24:14 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:24:14 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 20:24:14 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/SO LETS SET THIS WORLD ON FIRE
2017.01.28 20:24:14 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/(rabid gnawing sounds)
2017.01.28 20:24:15 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Oh man, they were just going nuts
2017.01.28 20:24:15 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/SO LETS SET THIS WORLD ON FIRE
2017.01.28 20:24:15 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/They were tearin' me apart
2017.01.28 20:24:15 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I believe it went a little something like this . . .
2017.01.28 20:24:15 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Doh
2017.01.28 20:24:15 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/SO LETS SET THIS WORLD ON FIRE
2017.01.28 20:24:16 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:24:16 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Oh
2017.01.28 20:24:16 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/No, get 'em off, get 'em off
2017.01.28 20:24:16 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Oh, oh God, oh God
2017.01.28 20:24:17 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/SO LETS SET THIS WORLD ON FIRE
2017.01.28 20:24:17 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Oh, oh God
2017.01.28 20:24:17 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Ah, (more screaming)
2017.01.28 20:24:17 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
2017.01.28 20:24:17 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'
2017.01.28 20:24:17 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/SO LETS SET THIS WORLD ON FIRE
2017.01.28 20:24:17 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Like a constipated weiner dog
2017.01.28 20:24:18 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
2017.01.28 20:24:18 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Her name was Zelda
2017.01.28 20:24:18 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/xD
2017.01.28 20:24:18 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 20:24:18 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:24:19 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:24:19 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 20:24:19 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:24:19 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 20:24:20 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
2017.01.28 20:24:20 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah
2017.01.28 20:24:20 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
2017.01.28 20:24:20 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "Woah, hold on now, baby"
2017.01.28 20:24:21 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment"
2017.01.28 20:24:21 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So we broke up and I never saw her again
2017.01.28 20:24:21 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But that's just the way things go
2017.01.28 20:24:21 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:24:21 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:24:22 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
2017.01.28 20:24:22 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 20:24:22 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face
2017.01.28 20:24:22 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
2017.01.28 20:24:23 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 20:24:23 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:24:23 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:24:23 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:24:24 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"
2017.01.28 20:24:24 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So I did
2017.01.28 20:24:24 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:24:24 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, that's just great
2017.01.28 20:24:25 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/How was I supposed to know that?
2017.01.28 20:24:25 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:24:25 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So what's he complaining about?
2017.01.28 20:24:25 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
2017.01.28 20:24:26 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:24:26 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
2017.01.28 20:24:26 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:24:26 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 20:24:27 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/(screaming sounds)
2017.01.28 20:24:27 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 20:24:27 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 20:24:27 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Kinda lost my train of thought
2017.01.28 20:24:28 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 20:24:28 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
2017.01.28 20:24:28 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is
2017.01.28 20:24:28 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I hate sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:24:28 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's all I'm really tryin' to say
2017.01.28 20:24:29 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And find yourself in an existential quandary
2017.01.28 20:24:29 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Full of loathing and self-doubt
2017.01.28 20:24:29 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
2017.01.28 20:24:29 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours
2017.01.28 20:24:30 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/There's still a little place called
2017.01.28 20:24:30 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/LOL
2017.01.28 20:24:30 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Albuquerque

2017.01.28 20:24:33 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:24:33 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop
2017.01.28 20:24:33 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/You know the place
2017.01.28 20:24:33 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
2017.01.28 20:24:34 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast
2017.01.28 20:24:34 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Awww - Big bowl of sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:24:34 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/It was driving me crazy
2017.01.28 20:24:34 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said to my mom
2017.01.28 20:24:35 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "Hey, mom, what's with all the sauerkraut?"
2017.01.28 20:24:35 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And my dear, sweet mother
2017.01.28 20:24:35 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train
2017.01.28 20:24:35 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And she leaned right down next to me
2017.01.28 20:24:35 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And she said "IT'S GOOD FOR YOU"
2017.01.28 20:24:35 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
2017.01.28 20:24:36 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
2017.01.28 20:24:36 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's when I swore that someday
2017.01.28 20:24:36 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
2017.01.28 20:24:36 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
2017.01.28 20:24:36 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:24:37 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
2017.01.28 20:24:37 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel
2017.01.28 20:24:37 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Wacka wacka doodoo yeah
2017.01.28 20:24:37 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
2017.01.28 20:24:37 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
2017.01.28 20:24:38 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
2017.01.28 20:24:38 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
2017.01.28 20:24:38 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's right, a first class one-way ticket to
2017.01.28 20:24:38 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:24:38 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:24:39 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
2017.01.28 20:24:39 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
2017.01.28 20:24:39 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
2017.01.28 20:24:40 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
2017.01.28 20:24:40 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 20:24:40 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:24:40 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:24:40 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Except for me
2017.01.28 20:24:40 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/You know why?
2017.01.28 20:24:41 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/'Cause I had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:24:41 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:24:41 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/This is heaven xD
2017.01.28 20:24:41 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:24:41 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:24:42 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Ah ha ha ha
2017.01.28 20:24:42 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Ah ha ha
2017.01.28 20:24:42 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Ah
2017.01.28 20:24:43 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:24:43 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
2017.01.28 20:24:43 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
2017.01.28 20:24:43 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
2017.01.28 20:24:43 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:24:44 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 20:24:44 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
2017.01.28 20:24:44 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I turned on the SpectraVision
2017.01.28 20:24:44 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
2017.01.28 20:24:45 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well now, who could that be?
2017.01.28 20:24:45 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:24:45 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/No answer
2017.01.28 20:24:46 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/There's no answer
2017.01.28 20:24:46 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"WHO IS IT?"
2017.01.28 20:24:46 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/They're not sayin' anything
2017.01.28 20:24:46 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
2017.01.28 20:24:46 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 20:24:47 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 20:24:47 G/survival/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/XDDD
2017.01.28 20:24:47 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 20:24:47 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And he's like "Tough"
2017.01.28 20:24:47 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 20:24:48 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 20:24:48 G/survival/Spiderman(MM)/cardhady/angel stop
2017.01.28 20:24:48 G/survival/Zoom/BubbaTruk/anchovii
2017.01.28 20:24:48 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:24:48 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 20:24:49 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Yes indeed, you better believe it
2017.01.28 20:24:49 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
2017.01.28 20:24:49 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice
2017.01.28 20:24:49 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And you know what it said?
2017.01.28 20:24:49 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I'll tell you what it said
2017.01.28 20:24:49 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/It said
2017.01.28 20:24:50 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"

2017.01.28 20:24:51 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
2017.01.28 20:24:51 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
2017.01.28 20:24:51 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice
2017.01.28 20:24:52 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop
2017.01.28 20:24:52 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
2017.01.28 20:24:52 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And he says "Yeah, what do ya want?"

2017.01.28 20:24:55 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"
2017.01.28 20:24:55 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He says "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"
2017.01.28 20:24:55 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I said "OK, I'll take that"
2017.01.28 20:24:55 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:24:55 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 20:24:55 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/(rabid gnawing sounds)
2017.01.28 20:24:56 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Oh man, they were just going nuts
2017.01.28 20:24:56 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head"
2017.01.28 20:24:56 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I believe it went a little something like this . . .
2017.01.28 20:24:56 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Doh

2017.01.28 20:24:59 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
2017.01.28 20:24:59 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
2017.01.28 20:24:59 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 20:24:59 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/yes bubba?
2017.01.28 20:24:59 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:25:00 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:25:00 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/We were inseparable after that
2017.01.28 20:25:00 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 20:25:00 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:25:01 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So we got married and we bought us a house
2017.01.28 20:25:01 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
2017.01.28 20:25:01 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah
2017.01.28 20:25:01 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/She said "Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?"

2017.01.28 20:25:02 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But that's just the way things go
2017.01.28 20:25:02 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/In Albuquerque

2017.01.28 20:25:03 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
2017.01.28 20:25:03 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 20:25:03 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face
2017.01.28 20:25:04 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I was gettin' a lot of attitude
2017.01.28 20:25:04 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 20:25:04 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:25:04 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So I, I say to him, I say "Hey, you want me to help you with that?"
2017.01.28 20:25:04 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:25:05 G/rules/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/YAY
2017.01.28 20:25:05 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/"No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"
2017.01.28 20:25:05 G/survival/Zoom/BubbaTruk/can you help me get to the labs
2017.01.28 20:25:05 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And then he gets all indignant on me
2017.01.28 20:25:05 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:25:05 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, that's just great
2017.01.28 20:25:06 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
2017.01.28 20:25:06 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:25:06 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/So what's he complaining about?
2017.01.28 20:25:07 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
2017.01.28 20:25:07 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:25:07 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
2017.01.28 20:25:07 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 20:25:08 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 20:25:08 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/(screaming sounds)
2017.01.28 20:25:08 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?
2017.01.28 20:25:08 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 20:25:08 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Kinda lost my train of thought
2017.01.28 20:25:09 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
2017.01.28 20:25:09 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is
2017.01.28 20:25:09 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/I hate sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:25:10 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
2017.01.28 20:25:10 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/And find yourself in an existential quandary
2017.01.28 20:25:10 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Full of loathing and self-doubt
2017.01.28 20:25:10 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
2017.01.28 20:25:10 G/chess/The Matrix/Angel__Boy/Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours

2017.01.28 20:25:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:25:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
2017.01.28 20:25:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel
2017.01.28 20:25:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
2017.01.28 20:25:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
2017.01.28 20:25:53 G/greenfield/Zoom/BubbaTruk/anchovii
2017.01.28 20:25:53 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/Welp
2017.01.28 20:25:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
2017.01.28 20:25:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, a first class one-way ticket to
2017.01.28 20:25:54 G/rules/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/NOOO
2017.01.28 20:25:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:25:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:25:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
2017.01.28 20:25:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
2017.01.28 20:25:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
2017.01.28 20:25:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
2017.01.28 20:25:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:25:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
2017.01.28 20:25:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 20:25:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:25:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:25:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except for me
2017.01.28 20:25:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know why?
2017.01.28 20:25:57 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/You guys are lucky
2017.01.28 20:25:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:25:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:25:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:25:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:25:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:25:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha ha
2017.01.28 20:25:58 G/survival/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/;-;
2017.01.28 20:25:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha
2017.01.28 20:25:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
2017.01.28 20:25:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:25:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
2017.01.28 20:25:58 G/greenfield/Zoom/BubbaTruk/can you tp ian to me?
2017.01.28 20:25:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:25:59 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/Angel do it again xD
2017.01.28 20:25:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
2017.01.28 20:25:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:25:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 20:26:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's OK, they're clean
2017.01.28 20:26:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
2017.01.28 20:26:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I turned on the SpectraVision
2017.01.28 20:26:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 20:26:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well now, who could that be?
2017.01.28 20:26:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:26:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:26:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's no answer
2017.01.28 20:26:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "WHO IS IT?"
2017.01.28 20:26:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 20:26:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
2017.01.28 20:26:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 20:26:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, you can't have that"
2017.01.28 20:26:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 20:26:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Tough"
2017.01.28 20:26:03 G/survival/Spiderman(MM)/cardhady/no
2017.01.28 20:26:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:26:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 20:26:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:26:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
2017.01.28 20:26:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Yes indeed, you better believe it
2017.01.28 20:26:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
2017.01.28 20:26:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you know what it said?
2017.01.28 20:26:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll tell you what it said
2017.01.28 20:26:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It said
2017.01.28 20:26:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:26:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:26:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:26:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
2017.01.28 20:26:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
2017.01.28 20:26:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But first, I decided to buy some donuts
2017.01.28 20:26:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop
2017.01.28 20:26:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
2017.01.28 20:26:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he says "Yeah, what do ya want?"
2017.01.28 20:26:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any glazed donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:26:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta glazed donuts"
2017.01.28 20:26:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, you got any jelly donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:26:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:26:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts"
2017.01.28 20:26:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any cinnamon rolls?"
2017.01.28 20:26:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any apple fritters?"
2017.01.28 20:26:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta apple fritters"
2017.01.28 20:26:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any bear claws?"
2017.01.28 20:26:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, we're outta bear claws"
2017.01.28 20:26:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"
2017.01.28 20:26:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He says "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"
2017.01.28 20:26:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:26:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 20:26:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (rabid gnawing sounds)
2017.01.28 20:26:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, they were just going nuts
2017.01.28 20:26:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They were tearin' me apart
2017.01.28 20:26:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head"
2017.01.28 20:26:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I believe it went a little something like this . . .
2017.01.28 20:26:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:26:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:26:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh
2017.01.28 20:26:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No, get 'em off, get 'em off
2017.01.28 20:26:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, oh God, oh God
2017.01.28 20:26:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:26:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, oh God
2017.01.28 20:26:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
2017.01.28 20:26:14 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/I like that song :D
2017.01.28 20:26:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'
2017.01.28 20:26:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Like a constipated weiner dog
2017.01.28 20:26:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
2017.01.28 20:26:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Her name was Zelda
2017.01.28 20:26:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
2017.01.28 20:26:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 20:26:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:26:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:26:15 G/survival/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/Though, RIP chat.
2017.01.28 20:26:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We were inseparable after that
2017.01.28 20:26:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 20:26:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 20:26:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we got married and we bought us a house
2017.01.28 20:26:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
2017.01.28 20:26:16 G/greenfield/Zoom/BubbaTruk/anchovii can you tp ian to me
2017.01.28 20:26:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
2017.01.28 20:26:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?"
2017.01.28 20:26:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Woah, hold on now, baby"
2017.01.28 20:26:17 G/greenfield/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/Hark can you tp me to the lab please
2017.01.28 20:26:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we broke up and I never saw her again
2017.01.28 20:26:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But that's just the way things go
2017.01.28 20:26:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
2017.01.28 20:26:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
2017.01.28 20:26:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 20:26:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
2017.01.28 20:26:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was gettin' a lot of attitude
2017.01.28 20:26:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 20:26:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:26:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:26:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I, I say to him, I say "Hey, you want me to help you with that?"
2017.01.28 20:26:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:26:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I did
2017.01.28 20:26:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then he gets all indignant on me
2017.01.28 20:26:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:26:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: How was I supposed to know that?
2017.01.28 20:26:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
2017.01.28 20:26:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:26:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
2017.01.28 20:26:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
2017.01.28 20:26:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:26:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:26:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 20:26:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 20:26:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 20:26:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?
2017.01.28 20:26:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 20:26:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 20:26:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
2017.01.28 20:26:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is
2017.01.28 20:26:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's all I'm really tryin' to say
2017.01.28 20:26:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
2017.01.28 20:26:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And find yourself in an existential quandary
2017.01.28 20:26:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Full of loathing and self-doubt
2017.01.28 20:26:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
2017.01.28 20:26:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
2017.01.28 20:26:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours
2017.01.28 20:26:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque

2017.01.28 20:26:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop
2017.01.28 20:26:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know the place
2017.01.28 20:26:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy
2017.01.28 20:26:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
2017.01.28 20:26:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Awww - Big bowl of sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:26:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Every single morning
2017.01.28 20:26:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It was driving me crazy
2017.01.28 20:26:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Hey, mom, what's with all the sauerkraut?"
2017.01.28 20:26:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my dear, sweet mother
2017.01.28 20:26:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train
2017.01.28 20:26:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she said "IT'S GOOD FOR YOU"
2017.01.28 20:26:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
2017.01.28 20:26:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
2017.01.28 20:26:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
2017.01.28 20:26:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
2017.01.28 20:26:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:26:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel
2017.01.28 20:26:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wacka wacka doodoo yeah
2017.01.28 20:26:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
2017.01.28 20:26:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
2017.01.28 20:26:34 G/greenfield/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/thanks
2017.01.28 20:26:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
2017.01.28 20:26:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
2017.01.28 20:26:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, a first class one-way ticket to
2017.01.28 20:26:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh yeah
2017.01.28 20:26:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
2017.01.28 20:26:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
2017.01.28 20:26:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
2017.01.28 20:26:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
2017.01.28 20:26:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:26:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 20:26:37 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/yw
2017.01.28 20:26:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:26:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:26:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know why?
2017.01.28 20:26:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: 'Cause I had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:26:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:26:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:26:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:26:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:26:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha
2017.01.28 20:26:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah
2017.01.28 20:26:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
2017.01.28 20:26:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:26:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
2017.01.28 20:26:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
2017.01.28 20:26:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:26:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:26:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 20:26:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's OK, they're clean
2017.01.28 20:26:41 G/greenfield/Zoom/BubbaTruk/thanks
2017.01.28 20:26:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I turned on the SpectraVision
2017.01.28 20:26:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
2017.01.28 20:26:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 20:26:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:26:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No answer
2017.01.28 20:26:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:26:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "WHO IS IT?"
2017.01.28 20:26:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They're not sayin' anything
2017.01.28 20:26:43 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/yw
2017.01.28 20:26:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 20:26:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 20:26:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 20:26:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, you can't have that"
2017.01.28 20:26:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Tough"
2017.01.28 20:26:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 20:26:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:26:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 20:26:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:26:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 20:26:45 G/greenfield/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/who shall I be?
2017.01.28 20:26:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
2017.01.28 20:26:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
2017.01.28 20:26:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice
2017.01.28 20:26:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you know what it said?
2017.01.28 20:26:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll tell you what it said
2017.01.28 20:26:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It said
2017.01.28 20:26:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:26:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:26:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:26:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
2017.01.28 20:26:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
2017.01.28 20:26:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice
2017.01.28 20:26:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But first, I decided to buy some donuts
2017.01.28 20:26:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
2017.01.28 20:26:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he says "Yeah, what do ya want?"
2017.01.28 20:26:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any glazed donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:26:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, you got any jelly donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:26:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta jelly donuts"
2017.01.28 20:26:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:26:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any cinnamon rolls?"
2017.01.28 20:26:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta cinnamon rolls"
2017.01.28 20:26:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any apple fritters?"
2017.01.28 20:26:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any bear claws?"
2017.01.28 20:26:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "Wait a minute, I'll go check"
2017.01.28 20:26:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, we're outta bear claws"
2017.01.28 20:26:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"
2017.01.28 20:26:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He says "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"
2017.01.28 20:26:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "OK, I'll take that"
2017.01.28 20:26:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:26:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (rabid gnawing sounds)
2017.01.28 20:26:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, they were just going nuts
2017.01.28 20:26:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They were tearin' me apart
2017.01.28 20:26:53 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/Spectre
2017.01.28 20:26:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I believe it went a little something like this . . .
2017.01.28 20:26:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Doh
2017.01.28 20:26:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:26:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh
2017.01.28 20:26:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No, get 'em off, get 'em off
2017.01.28 20:26:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, oh God, oh God
2017.01.28 20:26:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, oh God
2017.01.28 20:26:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah, (more screaming)
2017.01.28 20:26:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
2017.01.28 20:26:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Like a constipated weiner dog
2017.01.28 20:26:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
2017.01.28 20:26:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Her name was Zelda
2017.01.28 20:26:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 20:26:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:26:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:26:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 20:26:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:26:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 20:26:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
2017.01.28 20:26:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah
2017.01.28 20:26:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
2017.01.28 20:26:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Woah, hold on now, baby"
2017.01.28 20:26:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment"
2017.01.28 20:26:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we broke up and I never saw her again
2017.01.28 20:26:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:26:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
2017.01.28 20:27:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 20:27:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face
2017.01.28 20:27:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
2017.01.28 20:27:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 20:27:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:27:01 G/greenfield/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/\_ ._. _/
2017.01.28 20:27:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:27:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:27:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"
2017.01.28 20:27:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I did
2017.01.28 20:27:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:27:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, that's just great
2017.01.28 20:27:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: How was I supposed to know that?
2017.01.28 20:27:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:27:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So what's he complaining about?
2017.01.28 20:27:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
2017.01.28 20:27:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:27:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
2017.01.28 20:27:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:27:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 20:27:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 20:27:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (screaming sounds)
2017.01.28 20:27:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 20:27:05 G/greenfield/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/ok
2017.01.28 20:27:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 20:27:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Kinda lost my train of thought
2017.01.28 20:27:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 20:27:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is
2017.01.28 20:27:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I hate sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:27:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's all I'm really tryin' to say
2017.01.28 20:27:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And find yourself in an existential quandary
2017.01.28 20:27:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Full of loathing and self-doubt
2017.01.28 20:27:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
2017.01.28 20:27:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours
2017.01.28 20:27:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's still a little place called
2017.01.28 20:27:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "A" (A)
2017.01.28 20:27:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "L" (L)
2017.01.28 20:27:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "B" (B)
2017.01.28 20:27:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "querque" (querque)
2017.01.28 20:27:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop
2017.01.28 20:27:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know the place
2017.01.28 20:27:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
2017.01.28 20:27:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast
2017.01.28 20:27:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Awww - Big bowl of sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:27:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It was driving me crazy
2017.01.28 20:27:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said to my mom
2017.01.28 20:27:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Hey, mom, what's with all the sauerkraut?"
2017.01.28 20:27:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train
2017.01.28 20:27:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she leaned right down next to me
2017.01.28 20:27:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she said "IT'S GOOD FOR YOU"
2017.01.28 20:27:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
2017.01.28 20:27:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I swore that someday
2017.01.28 20:27:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
2017.01.28 20:27:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:27:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
2017.01.28 20:27:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel
2017.01.28 20:27:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
2017.01.28 20:27:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
2017.01.28 20:27:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
2017.01.28 20:27:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, a first class one-way ticket to
2017.01.28 20:27:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh yeah
2017.01.28 20:27:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
2017.01.28 20:27:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
2017.01.28 20:27:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
2017.01.28 20:27:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:27:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
2017.01.28 20:27:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 20:27:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:27:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except for me
2017.01.28 20:27:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know why?
2017.01.28 20:27:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:27:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:27:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:27:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:27:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha ha
2017.01.28 20:27:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha
2017.01.28 20:27:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
2017.01.28 20:27:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:27:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
2017.01.28 20:27:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:27:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
2017.01.28 20:27:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:27:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's OK, they're clean
2017.01.28 20:27:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
2017.01.28 20:27:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I turned on the SpectraVision
2017.01.28 20:27:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
2017.01.28 20:27:23 G/greenfield/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/guys
2017.01.28 20:27:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 20:27:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well now, who could that be?
2017.01.28 20:27:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:27:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:27:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's no answer
2017.01.28 20:27:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "WHO IS IT?"
2017.01.28 20:27:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 20:27:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
2017.01.28 20:27:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 20:27:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, you can't have that"
2017.01.28 20:27:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 20:27:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Tough"
2017.01.28 20:27:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:27:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 20:27:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:27:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
2017.01.28 20:27:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Yes indeed, you better believe it
2017.01.28 20:27:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
2017.01.28 20:27:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice
2017.01.28 20:27:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you know what it said?
2017.01.28 20:27:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll tell you what it said
2017.01.28 20:27:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It said
2017.01.28 20:27:28 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:27:28 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:27:28 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:27:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
2017.01.28 20:27:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
2017.01.28 20:27:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But first, I decided to buy some donuts
2017.01.28 20:27:29 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop
2017.01.28 20:27:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
2017.01.28 20:27:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any glazed donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:27:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta glazed donuts"
2017.01.28 20:27:30 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, you got any jelly donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:27:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:27:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts"
2017.01.28 20:27:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any cinnamon rolls?"
2017.01.28 20:27:31 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any apple fritters?"
2017.01.28 20:27:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta apple fritters"
2017.01.28 20:27:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any bear claws?"
2017.01.28 20:27:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, we're outta bear claws"
2017.01.28 20:27:32 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"
2017.01.28 20:27:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He says "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"
2017.01.28 20:27:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:27:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 20:27:33 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (rabid gnawing sounds)
2017.01.28 20:27:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They were tearin' me apart
2017.01.28 20:27:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head"
2017.01.28 20:27:34 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I believe it went a little something like this . . .
2017.01.28 20:27:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:27:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:27:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh
2017.01.28 20:27:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, oh God, oh God
2017.01.28 20:27:35 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:27:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, oh God
2017.01.28 20:27:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
2017.01.28 20:27:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'
2017.01.28 20:27:36 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Like a constipated weiner dog
2017.01.28 20:27:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Her name was Zelda
2017.01.28 20:27:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
2017.01.28 20:27:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 20:27:37 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:27:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:27:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We were inseparable after that
2017.01.28 20:27:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 20:27:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:27:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 20:27:38 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we got married and we bought us a house
2017.01.28 20:27:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
2017.01.28 20:27:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
2017.01.28 20:27:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?"
2017.01.28 20:27:39 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Woah, hold on now, baby"
2017.01.28 20:27:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we broke up and I never saw her again
2017.01.28 20:27:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But that's just the way things go
2017.01.28 20:27:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:40 G/greenfield/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/is it me or do you not see any numbers on the machine
2017.01.28 20:27:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
2017.01.28 20:27:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
2017.01.28 20:27:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 20:27:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
2017.01.28 20:27:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was gettin' a lot of attitude
2017.01.28 20:27:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 20:27:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:27:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:27:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I, I say to him, I say "Hey, you want me to help you with that?"
2017.01.28 20:27:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:27:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"
2017.01.28 20:27:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I did
2017.01.28 20:27:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then he gets all indignant on me
2017.01.28 20:27:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:27:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: How was I supposed to know that?
2017.01.28 20:27:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
2017.01.28 20:27:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:27:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
2017.01.28 20:27:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
2017.01.28 20:27:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:27:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:27:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 20:27:45 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/AWWW
2017.01.28 20:27:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 20:27:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 20:27:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?
2017.01.28 20:27:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 20:27:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 20:27:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
2017.01.28 20:27:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is
2017.01.28 20:27:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's all I'm really tryin' to say
2017.01.28 20:27:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
2017.01.28 20:27:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And find yourself in an existential quandary
2017.01.28 20:27:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
2017.01.28 20:27:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
2017.01.28 20:27:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours
2017.01.28 20:27:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "A" (A)
2017.01.28 20:27:50 G/greenfield/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/is it me?
2017.01.28 20:27:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "B" (B)
2017.01.28 20:27:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "U" (U)
2017.01.28 20:27:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "querque" (querque)
2017.01.28 20:27:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:52 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/Angel__Boy said he met a girl named ZELDA
2017.01.28 20:27:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop
2017.01.28 20:27:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know the place
2017.01.28 20:27:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy
2017.01.28 20:27:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
2017.01.28 20:27:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast
2017.01.28 20:27:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Awww - Big bowl of sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:27:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Every single morning
2017.01.28 20:27:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It was driving me crazy
2017.01.28 20:27:53 G/survival/Mr. Mxyzptlk/_V_Anchovii_V_/ANGEL SING AGAIN :D
2017.01.28 20:27:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Hey, mom, what's with all the sauerkraut?"
2017.01.28 20:27:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my dear, sweet mother
2017.01.28 20:27:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train
2017.01.28 20:27:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she said "IT'S GOOD FOR YOU"
2017.01.28 20:27:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
2017.01.28 20:27:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
2017.01.28 20:27:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
2017.01.28 20:27:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
2017.01.28 20:27:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:27:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel
2017.01.28 20:27:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wacka wacka doodoo yeah
2017.01.28 20:27:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
2017.01.28 20:27:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
2017.01.28 20:27:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
2017.01.28 20:27:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, a first class one-way ticket to
2017.01.28 20:27:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:27:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh yeah
2017.01.28 20:27:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
2017.01.28 20:27:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
2017.01.28 20:27:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
2017.01.28 20:27:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:27:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 20:27:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:27:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:28:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know why?
2017.01.28 20:28:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: 'Cause I had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:28:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:28:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:28:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:28:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:28:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha
2017.01.28 20:28:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah
2017.01.28 20:28:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
2017.01.28 20:28:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
2017.01.28 20:28:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
2017.01.28 20:28:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:28:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:28:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 20:28:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's OK, they're clean
2017.01.28 20:28:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
2017.01.28 20:28:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I turned on the SpectraVision
2017.01.28 20:28:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
2017.01.28 20:28:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 20:28:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:28:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No answer
2017.01.28 20:28:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:28:05 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/He Leonard Noimy's butt
2017.01.28 20:28:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "WHO IS IT?"
2017.01.28 20:28:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They're not sayin' anything
2017.01.28 20:28:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 20:28:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 20:28:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 20:28:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, you can't have that"
2017.01.28 20:28:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Tough"
2017.01.28 20:28:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 20:28:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:28:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:28:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 20:28:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
2017.01.28 20:28:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
2017.01.28 20:28:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice
2017.01.28 20:28:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you know what it said?
2017.01.28 20:28:08 G/greenfield/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/Please dont't

2017.01.28 20:28:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:28:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:28:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:28:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:28:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:28:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
2017.01.28 20:28:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice
2017.01.28 20:28:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But first, I decided to buy some donuts
2017.01.28 20:28:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
2017.01.28 20:28:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he says "Yeah, what do ya want?"
2017.01.28 20:28:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any glazed donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:28:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, you got any jelly donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:28:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta jelly donuts"
2017.01.28 20:28:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:28:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts"
2017.01.28 20:28:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any cinnamon rolls?"
2017.01.28 20:28:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta cinnamon rolls"
2017.01.28 20:28:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any apple fritters?"
2017.01.28 20:28:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any bear claws?"
2017.01.28 20:28:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "Wait a minute, I'll go check"
2017.01.28 20:28:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, we're outta bear claws"
2017.01.28 20:28:13 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/IanAloveslegos ur lucky
2017.01.28 20:28:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He says "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"
2017.01.28 20:28:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "OK, I'll take that"
2017.01.28 20:28:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:28:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 20:28:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (rabid gnawing sounds)
2017.01.28 20:28:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, they were just going nuts
2017.01.28 20:28:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They were tearin' me apart
2017.01.28 20:28:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I believe it went a little something like this . . .
2017.01.28 20:28:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Doh

2017.01.28 20:28:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
2017.01.28 20:28:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Her name was Zelda
2017.01.28 20:28:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 20:28:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:28:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:28:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 20:28:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:28:19 G/greenfield/Undyne/IanAloveslegos/:l
2017.01.28 20:28:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 20:28:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly

2017.01.28 20:28:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
2017.01.28 20:28:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Woah, hold on now, baby"
2017.01.28 20:28:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment"
2017.01.28 20:28:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we broke up and I never saw her again
2017.01.28 20:28:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:28:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:28:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
2017.01.28 20:28:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 20:28:22 G/rules/Doctor Manhattan/GalaxehPanda/My chat over here is getting spammed
2017.01.28 20:28:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face

2017.01.28 20:28:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 20:28:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:28:23 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:28:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:28:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"

2017.01.28 20:28:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I did

2017.01.28 20:28:24 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:28:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, that's just great

2017.01.28 20:28:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:28:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So what's he complaining about?
2017.01.28 20:28:25 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
2017.01.28 20:28:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:28:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
2017.01.28 20:28:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:28:26 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 20:28:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming

2017.01.28 20:28:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 20:28:27 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 20:28:28 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Kinda lost my train of thought

2017.01.28 20:28:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
2017.01.28 20:28:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
2017.01.28 20:28:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I swore that someday

2017.01.28 20:28:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:28:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
2017.01.28 20:28:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 20:28:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:28:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died

2017.01.28 20:28:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
2017.01.28 20:28:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:28:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
2017.01.28 20:28:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
2017.01.28 20:28:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:28:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
2017.01.28 20:28:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:28:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 20:28:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's OK, they're clean
2017.01.28 20:28:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
2017.01.28 20:28:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
2017.01.28 20:28:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 20:28:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well now, who could that be?
2017.01.28 20:28:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I say "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:28:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No answer
2017.01.28 20:28:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "Who is it?"
2017.01.28 20:28:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's no answer
2017.01.28 20:28:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They're not sayin' anything
2017.01.28 20:28:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
2017.01.28 20:28:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
2017.01.28 20:28:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
2017.01.28 20:28:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 20:29:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, you can't have that"
2017.01.28 20:29:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 20:29:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 20:29:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:29:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 20:29:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:29:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 20:29:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation

2017.01.28 20:29:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:29:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 20:29:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, they were just going nuts
2017.01.28 20:29:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: They were tearin' me apart

2017.01.28 20:29:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'
2017.01.28 20:29:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
2017.01.28 20:29:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Her name was Zelda
2017.01.28 20:29:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
2017.01.28 20:29:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 20:29:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:29:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:29:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We were inseparable after that
2017.01.28 20:29:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 20:29:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:29:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 20:29:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we got married and we bought us a house

2017.01.28 20:29:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment"

2017.01.28 20:29:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
2017.01.28 20:29:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 20:29:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face

2017.01.28 20:29:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:29:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:29:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I, I say to him, I say "Hey, you want me to help you with that?"
2017.01.28 20:29:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:29:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"

2017.01.28 20:29:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:29:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, that's just great
2017.01.28 20:29:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: How was I supposed to know that?
2017.01.28 20:29:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
2017.01.28 20:29:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:29:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So what's he complaining about?
2017.01.28 20:29:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
2017.01.28 20:29:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
2017.01.28 20:29:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:29:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
2017.01.28 20:29:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:29:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 20:29:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 20:29:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (screaming sounds)
2017.01.28 20:29:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 20:29:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?
2017.01.28 20:29:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 20:29:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Kinda lost my train of thought
2017.01.28 20:29:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 20:29:21 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
2017.01.28 20:29:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is
2017.01.28 20:29:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I hate sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:29:22 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's all I'm really tryin' to say

2017.01.28 20:29:40 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
2017.01.28 20:29:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me"
2017.01.28 20:29:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Tough"
2017.01.28 20:29:41 G/greenfield/Mortal/UltraOwlDC/Foxy
2017.01.28 20:29:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Give it"
2017.01.28 20:29:41 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's like "Make me"
2017.01.28 20:29:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "'Kay"
2017.01.28 20:29:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
2017.01.28 20:29:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
2017.01.28 20:29:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
2017.01.28 20:29:42 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Yes indeed, you better believe it
2017.01.28 20:29:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
2017.01.28 20:29:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice
2017.01.28 20:29:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you know what it said?
2017.01.28 20:29:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll tell you what it said
2017.01.28 20:29:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It said
2017.01.28 20:29:43 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:29:44 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:29:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again"
2017.01.28 20:29:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"
2017.01.28 20:29:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:29:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
2017.01.28 20:29:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
2017.01.28 20:29:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice
2017.01.28 20:29:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But first, I decided to buy some donuts
2017.01.28 20:29:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop
2017.01.28 20:29:45 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
2017.01.28 20:29:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he says "Yeah, what do ya want?"
2017.01.28 20:29:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any glazed donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:29:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta glazed donuts"
2017.01.28 20:29:46 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, you got any jelly donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:29:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?"
2017.01.28 20:29:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts"
2017.01.28 20:29:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any cinnamon rolls?"
2017.01.28 20:29:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta cinnamon rolls"
2017.01.28 20:29:47 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any apple fritters?"
2017.01.28 20:29:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "No, we're outta apple fritters"
2017.01.28 20:29:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "You got any bear claws?"
2017.01.28 20:29:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He said "Wait a minute, I'll go check"
2017.01.28 20:29:48 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"
2017.01.28 20:29:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He says "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"
2017.01.28 20:29:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "OK, I'll take that"
2017.01.28 20:29:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
2017.01.28 20:29:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
2017.01.28 20:29:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (rabid gnawing sounds)
2017.01.28 20:29:49 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh man, they were just going nuts
2017.01.28 20:29:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head"
2017.01.28 20:29:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I believe it went a little something like this . . .
2017.01.28 20:29:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Doh
2017.01.28 20:29:50 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:29:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:29:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh
2017.01.28 20:29:51 UltraOwlDC -> FoxyShadows: what are you doing?
2017.01.28 20:29:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: No, get 'em off, get 'em off
2017.01.28 20:29:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, oh God, oh God
2017.01.28 20:29:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, get 'em off me
2017.01.28 20:29:51 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, oh God
2017.01.28 20:29:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah, (more screaming)
2017.01.28 20:29:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
2017.01.28 20:29:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'
2017.01.28 20:29:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Like a constipated weiner dog
2017.01.28 20:29:52 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
2017.01.28 20:29:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Her name was Zelda
2017.01.28 20:29:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
2017.01.28 20:29:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'll never forget the first thing she said to me.
2017.01.28 20:29:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Hey, you've got weasels on your face"
2017.01.28 20:29:53 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I knew it was true love
2017.01.28 20:29:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We were inseparable after that
2017.01.28 20:29:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
2017.01.28 20:29:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
2017.01.28 20:29:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The world was our burrito
2017.01.28 20:29:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we got married and we bought us a house
2017.01.28 20:29:54 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
2017.01.28 20:29:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah
2017.01.28 20:29:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
2017.01.28 20:29:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She said "Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?"
2017.01.28 20:29:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Woah, hold on now, baby"
2017.01.28 20:29:55 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment"
2017.01.28 20:29:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So we broke up and I never saw her again
2017.01.28 20:29:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But that's just the way things go
2017.01.28 20:29:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: In Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:29:56 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:29:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
2017.01.28 20:29:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
2017.01.28 20:29:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face
2017.01.28 20:29:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
2017.01.28 20:29:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was gettin' a lot of attitude
2017.01.28 20:29:57 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
2017.01.28 20:29:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
2017.01.28 20:29:58 FoxyShadows -> UltraOwlDC: Building
2017.01.28 20:29:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
2017.01.28 20:29:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I, I say to him, I say "Hey, you want me to help you with that?"
2017.01.28 20:29:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
2017.01.28 20:29:58 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw"
2017.01.28 20:29:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then he gets all indignant on me
2017.01.28 20:29:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: He's like "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic"
2017.01.28 20:29:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, that's just great
2017.01.28 20:29:59 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: How was I supposed to know that?
2017.01.28 20:30:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
2017.01.28 20:30:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy
2017.01.28 20:30:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So what's he complaining about?
2017.01.28 20:30:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
2017.01.28 20:30:00 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I knew what he meant
2017.01.28 20:30:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
2017.01.28 20:30:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
2017.01.28 20:30:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm like "Hey, come on, don't you get it?"
2017.01.28 20:30:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
2017.01.28 20:30:01 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: (screaming sounds)
2017.01.28 20:30:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
2017.01.28 20:30:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?
2017.01.28 20:30:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway, um, um, where was I?
2017.01.28 20:30:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Kinda lost my train of thought
2017.01.28 20:30:02 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Uh, well, uh, OK
2017.01.28 20:30:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
2017.01.28 20:30:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is
2017.01.28 20:30:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I hate sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:30:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's all I'm really tryin' to say
2017.01.28 20:30:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
2017.01.28 20:30:03 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And find yourself in an existential quandary
2017.01.28 20:30:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Full of loathing and self-doubt
2017.01.28 20:30:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
2017.01.28 20:30:04 UltraOwlDC -> FoxyShadows: ok
2017.01.28 20:30:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours
2017.01.28 20:30:04 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: There's still a little place called
2017.01.28 20:30:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:05 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "A" (A)
2017.01.28 20:30:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "L" (L)
2017.01.28 20:30:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "B" (B)
2017.01.28 20:30:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "U" (U)
2017.01.28 20:30:06 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: "querque" (querque)
2017.01.28 20:30:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:07 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop
2017.01.28 20:30:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know the place
2017.01.28 20:30:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy
2017.01.28 20:30:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
2017.01.28 20:30:08 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast
2017.01.28 20:30:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Awww - Big bowl of sauerkraut
2017.01.28 20:30:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Every single morning
2017.01.28 20:30:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It was driving me crazy
2017.01.28 20:30:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said to my mom
2017.01.28 20:30:09 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I said "Hey, mom, what's with all the sauerkraut?"
2017.01.28 20:30:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my dear, sweet mother
2017.01.28 20:30:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train
2017.01.28 20:30:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she leaned right down next to me
2017.01.28 20:30:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And she said "IT'S GOOD FOR YOU"
2017.01.28 20:30:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
2017.01.28 20:30:10 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
2017.01.28 20:30:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's when I swore that someday
2017.01.28 20:30:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
2017.01.28 20:30:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
2017.01.28 20:30:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:30:11 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
2017.01.28 20:30:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel
2017.01.28 20:30:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Wacka wacka doodoo yeah
2017.01.28 20:30:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
2017.01.28 20:30:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
2017.01.28 20:30:12 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
2017.01.28 20:30:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
2017.01.28 20:30:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That's right, a first class one-way ticket to
2017.01.28 20:30:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Albuquerque
2017.01.28 20:30:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Oh yeah
2017.01.28 20:30:13 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
2017.01.28 20:30:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
2017.01.28 20:30:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
2017.01.28 20:30:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
2017.01.28 20:30:14 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
2017.01.28 20:30:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
2017.01.28 20:30:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
2017.01.28 20:30:15 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
2017.01.28 20:30:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: 'Cause I had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:30:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:30:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:30:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Had my tray table up
2017.01.28 20:30:16 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my seat back in the full upright position
2017.01.28 20:30:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah ha ha ha
2017.01.28 20:30:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Ah
2017.01.28 20:30:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
2017.01.28 20:30:17 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
2017.01.28 20:30:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
2017.01.28 20:30:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
2017.01.28 20:30:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
2017.01.28 20:30:18 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Where the towels are oh so fluffy
2017.01.28 20:30:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
2017.01.28 20:30:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: It's OK, they're clean
2017.01.28 20:30:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
2017.01.28 20:30:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
2017.01.28 20:30:19 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
2017.01.28 20:30:20 Angel__Boy -> GalaxehPanda: I say "Who is it?"
