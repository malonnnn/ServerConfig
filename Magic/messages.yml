# All in-game text can be controlled from this file.

# The default will always be loaded first, so the English messages will be used for any

# To see the current default builtin configs, look in this folder:

# Examples:
# Note that a "#" chararacter means the line is commented out and has no effect.
# Make sure to not comment out the lines you add, there should not be a space in front of the name, indentation is important.
