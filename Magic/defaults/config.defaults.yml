# Control wands' "Power" settings

# - "Super" construction spells (the two-click variants) will allow for larger dimension selections
# - Radius-based spells (inferno, storm, blob, blast, arrowrain, mob) will have a larger radius,
#   generally meaning "more" of whatever they do. Be careful with this one.
# - Additionally, all spells will have a longer range.
# All of these aspects can be controlled individually.
# Be aware that a wand can be "overclocked", meaning it has a power greater than 1. Spell properties
# will continue to scale up. This will never happen naturally, only via the "wand configure" command
# or a wand template with a pre-defined power greater than 1

### Economy Helpers

# These values are used to help create a balanced economy if you plan on selling wands, spells, or upgrades.
# Currently they are only visible on the Magic website, though I plan to incorporate them into the plugin in the near future.
# This will probably appear in the form of a "/magic sell <item>" command. This would work just like "/magic give <item>"
# except it would also give you the "worth" of the item as defined by your economy.

# This may be a simple chat message for balance-based economies (e.g. MSRP: $1,000), or it may
# give you physical items for an item-based economy. See the "worth_items" section below.

# The following modifiers affect wand pricing.
# A wand's price is calculated using the sum of the prices of all of its spells as a base.
# Wand properties  (mana, protection, etc) may also add value.
# Each of these values is multiplied by the wand property. Keep in mind that most properties naturally scale
# from 0-1, with some exceptions like mana regeneration and limits. Refer to the maximums set above (e.g. max_mana)
# for a good idea of how those values are going to scale.

# These numbers may look a little screwy,
# I was going for a base-2 kind of thing to hopefully make
# costs fall along even item stack limits. (64)

# This scales all of the prices down when using emeralds.
#
# Adjust the "worth" value below to scale an item-based economy up or down. A value of 1 will make
