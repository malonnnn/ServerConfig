# Modify this file to change the overall behavior of the Magic plugin.
# only include the options you want to modify.
#
# You can also add individual files to the config/ folder
#
# To see all available options, look in this folder:
# https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/tree/master/src/main/resources/defaults/config
#
# Options for sub-components (spells, wand templates, chest populator, etc) are 
# found in separate files.
#
# For customization help see: 
# https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/Customization
#

#
# Examples:
# Note that a "#" chararacter means the line is commented out and has no effect.
# Make sure to not comment out the lines you add, there should not be a space in front of the name, indentation is important.
# Use http://www.yamllint.com if you have issues with your config, make sure not to use tabs!
# 

# Load one of the included example configurations instead of the defaults.
# Current options: potter, safe, survival
# Any customizations will still be loaded on top of the example configs.
# example: potter

# Add one or more of the included example configurations on top of the defaults.
# The config.yml potion is not loaded, for sanity's sake.
# add_examples:
#   - potter
