[26.04.2017 03:47:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats exactly what a salesman is
[26.04.2017 03:47:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: a salesman advertises the product and influnces the sales and how the company is represented
[26.04.2017 03:47:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: are you saying you didnt do those things?
[26.04.2017 03:48:03] Bitslane: hey is this the parkour from the air temple
[26.04.2017 03:48:10] SpyJay_YT: A salesman is the guy making the sales, I was helping increase the population of the sales, and improve busiessn.
[26.04.2017 03:48:12] SpyJay_YT: Business*
[26.04.2017 03:48:20] Grim765Reaper: wtf
[26.04.2017 03:48:21] SpyJay_YT: Am I saying what?
[26.04.2017 03:48:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: what does "population of sales" mean?
[26.04.2017 03:48:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: do you mean number of sales?
[26.04.2017 03:48:44] SpyJay_YT: Yes.
[26.04.2017 03:48:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: you're still describing salesman, tbh
[26.04.2017 03:49:01] SpyJay_YT: Not really
[26.04.2017 03:49:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes really
[26.04.2017 03:49:09] SpyJay_YT: You're making this sound complicated lad

[26.04.2017 03:49:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: my point is that any company will hire a salesman like that, they are a dime a dozen. i guess if you want to work as a salesman for the rest of your life, then you were correct, you really can get job offers thrown at you
[26.04.2017 03:50:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay ur right we can be done

[26.04.2017 05:03:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: would be fun
[26.04.2017 05:03:58] SpyJay_YT: yep
[26.04.2017 05:04:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: alright bro gtg im gong to implement that reserve system tho
[26.04.2017 05:04:11] SpyJay_YT: btw
[26.04.2017 05:04:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: i know how to do it
[26.04.2017 05:04:16] SpyJay_YT: I have a question
[26.04.2017 05:04:36] SpyJay_YT: Could I be hired as a refferee? like, I want to be able to host official fights
[26.04.2017 05:04:42] SpyJay_YT: when ur busy
[26.04.2017 05:04:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: probs not, cuz even as you said, "you know a way to make huge money"
[26.04.2017 05:04:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: too much potential to be abused
[26.04.2017 05:05:06] SpyJay_YT: uh
[26.04.2017 05:05:09] SpyJay_YT: when did I say that?
[26.04.2017 05:05:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: oh maybe it wasnt you
[26.04.2017 05:05:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: even so, i dont think so
[26.04.2017 05:05:24] SpyJay_YT: I said I know how to win a battle easier
[26.04.2017 05:05:25] SpyJay_YT: lol
[26.04.2017 05:05:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: it might have been someone else
[26.04.2017 05:05:38] SpyJay_YT: You see, everyone is spamming hits, as if this was 1.8
[26.04.2017 05:05:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah
[26.04.2017 05:05:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: exactly
[26.04.2017 05:05:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: dis aint 1.8
[26.04.2017 05:05:52] SpyJay_YT: But since 1.9 you have to hit at the right times
[26.04.2017 05:05:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats my secret
[26.04.2017 05:05:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: let that bar refill
[26.04.2017 05:06:00] God_Doesnt_Exist: and get crits
[26.04.2017 05:06:12] SpyJay_YT: I mean, you can spam, but it won't do as much damage
[26.04.2017 05:06:29] SpyJay_YT: Thats why I've seen people do 2 hearts damage in one hit
[26.04.2017 05:06:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: but it's about balance
[26.04.2017 05:06:32] SpyJay_YT: yep
[26.04.2017 05:06:45] God_Doesnt_Exist: i spam sometimes when my opponent is out of view and im searching to get my crosshairs back on him
[26.04.2017 05:06:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: but if ive got good shots, then well-timed shots is where it lies
[26.04.2017 05:07:14] SpyJay_YT: So, what else is stopping me from being aref
[26.04.2017 05:07:16] SpyJay_YT: a ref*
[26.04.2017 05:07:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: that i probs won't let anyone be a ref
[26.04.2017 05:07:31] SpyJay_YT: I mean, you're the only person who can do offical fights
[26.04.2017 05:07:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: right
[26.04.2017 05:07:44] SpyJay_YT: and, it wouldn't hurt to have a side person do it
[26.04.2017 05:07:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: it could hurt
[26.04.2017 05:08:13] SpyJay_YT: how?
[26.04.2017 05:08:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: all it takes is one thrown fight and one bad call
[26.04.2017 05:08:41] SpyJay_YT: what do you mean?
[26.04.2017 05:08:56] SpyJay_YT: You do know I'm basically asking for perms to do /offical?
[26.04.2017 05:09:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes i do and im declining that
[26.04.2017 05:09:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: its too easy to abuse
[26.04.2017 05:09:35] SpyJay_YT: Gde, I don't even know/understand how it can be abused, what harm can I do?
[26.04.2017 05:09:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: a thrown fight with people betting on the underdog would cause huge payouts
[26.04.2017 05:10:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: ask u saw earlier with our 7.25k win
[26.04.2017 05:10:25] SpyJay_YT: What do you mean by
[26.04.2017 05:10:27] SpyJay_YT: thrown fight
[26.04.2017 05:10:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: when a fight is thrown that means someone loses on purpose
[26.04.2017 05:11:04] SpyJay_YT: Dude, I have nothing to do with competitors, I'm basically turning a fight into
[26.04.2017 05:11:15] SpyJay_YT: record fight
[26.04.2017 05:11:24] SpyJay_YT: Oh.. I understand now
[26.04.2017 05:11:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: i suppose i could give you a command that records wins/losses but no bets
[26.04.2017 05:11:55] SpyJay_YT: Dude I won't do anything to harm bets, honestly
[26.04.2017 05:12:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: just like 20 minutes ago u were telling me to make the fight official where i /killed him
[26.04.2017 05:12:37] The_Erbinator: bdvs
[26.04.2017 05:12:39] SpyJay_YT: I didn't know you /killed him
[26.04.2017 05:12:43] SpyJay_YT: and
[26.04.2017 05:12:51] SpyJay_YT: I was reffering to when I put a bet down
[26.04.2017 05:13:09] SpyJay_YT: I didn't mean anything by it, I just said it wasn't official
[26.04.2017 05:13:14] SpyJay_YT: thats why i didnt win money
[26.04.2017 05:13:17] SpyJay_YT: thats all I was saying
[26.04.2017 05:13:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: i know, but my point is you didnt even notice the chat that said "god_doesnt_exist exploded the body of aldrin"
[26.04.2017 05:13:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: so idk how good of a ref u can really be
[26.04.2017 05:14:04] God_Doesnt_Exist: like the fight was like 5 seconds long and u somehow didnt notice
[26.04.2017 05:14:07] SpyJay_YT: Me not knowing how someone died, doesn't really have anything to do with it
[26.04.2017 05:14:20] SpyJay_YT: You're staff, with all perms
[26.04.2017 05:14:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah it does when it literalyl says it right next to who won and how they won
[26.04.2017 05:14:22] SpyJay_YT: normally
[26.04.2017 05:14:29] SpyJay_YT: a fight can only end by fist
[26.04.2017 05:14:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: u can see the same death messages i do
[26.04.2017 05:14:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: obviously not
[26.04.2017 05:14:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: i /killed him
[26.04.2017 05:14:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: ppl can also try to escape and they die
[26.04.2017 05:14:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: so u dont even know all the rules
[26.04.2017 05:14:57] SpyJay_YT: I said normally..
[26.04.2017 05:15:00] SpyJay_YT: not always
[26.04.2017 05:15:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: so what are you getting it?
[26.04.2017 05:15:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: at*
[26.04.2017 05:15:24] SpyJay_YT: What I'm saying is
[26.04.2017 05:16:03] SpyJay_YT: I mainly didn't notice it because I'm used to ppl being killed by fist, even escape deaths rarely happened, it's normal for me to not realize a different death
[26.04.2017 05:16:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: if its normal for you not realize different deaths, then i have to decline you as ref as i need a ref who that's not normal for
[26.04.2017 05:17:17] SpyJay_YT: I don't understand how me seeing how a person dies is so important dude
[26.04.2017 05:17:26] SpyJay_YT: I'm simply wanted to let people earn money when you're too busy
[26.04.2017 05:17:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: people can earn money while im busy
[26.04.2017 05:17:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats what serverwork and money room is for
[26.04.2017 05:17:43] SpyJay_YT: in fights
[26.04.2017 05:17:52] SpyJay_YT: enjoying themselves
[26.04.2017 05:18:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes but as i said, its too easy to abuse and the only person i trust is xsparkz
[26.04.2017 05:18:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: plus i play quite often, thers plenty of official fights
[26.04.2017 05:18:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: plus i play quite often, thers plenty of official fights
[26.04.2017 05:18:30] SpyJay_YT: I seriously don't know how this became a federal case
[26.04.2017 05:18:33] SpyJay_YT: How about this:
[26.04.2017 05:18:56] SpyJay_YT: I get the ability to host offical fights, and if I don't do well, it gets taken away, no questions asked.
[26.04.2017 05:19:02] SpyJay_YT: only 1 chance
[26.04.2017 05:19:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: no because its too hard to track abuse
[26.04.2017 05:19:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: thers no good way to track it
[26.04.2017 05:19:37] SpyJay_YT: but you're on often
[26.04.2017 05:19:38] SpyJay_YT: :L
[26.04.2017 05:19:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: if thats your argument then we dont need another ref
[26.04.2017 05:20:22] SpyJay_YT: :L
[26.04.2017 05:20:28] SpyJay_YT: Can I please have one chance
[26.04.2017 05:20:40] SpyJay_YT: We go way back, you should be able to trust my word.
[26.04.2017 05:20:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: what do you mean we go way back?
[26.04.2017 05:20:59] SpyJay_YT: I've played this server for a while
[26.04.2017 05:20:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think you've only been playing here like a year
[26.04.2017 05:21:09] SpyJay_YT: eh, year and a half
[26.04.2017 05:21:24] SpyJay_YT: This might be a 6 year old server
[26.04.2017 05:21:27] SpyJay_YT: but
[26.04.2017 05:21:37] SpyJay_YT: That's pretty long in my world
[26.04.2017 05:22:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: if i were to give it to you
[26.04.2017 05:22:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: i can tell you what would happen
[26.04.2017 05:22:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: it would go good for like a day or two
[26.04.2017 05:23:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: then you're going to make a bad call
[26.04.2017 05:23:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: it'll get removed
[26.04.2017 05:23:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: and you will get angry
[26.04.2017 05:23:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: and you will say "you were just looking for any reason to take it away"
[26.04.2017 05:23:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: and i won't be able to deny that claim
[26.04.2017 05:23:28] SpyJay_YT: Then give me a chance to prove it wrong
[26.04.2017 05:23:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: you read what i said?
[26.04.2017 05:23:58] SpyJay_YT: I honestly don't see how I can make a bad call
[26.04.2017 05:24:11] SpyJay_YT: Here's the way I think of it Gde
[26.04.2017 05:24:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is something like calling it official when someone tries to escape
[26.04.2017 05:24:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is calling it official when someone is afk
[26.04.2017 05:24:45] SpyJay_YT: I think of it has being able to host fights that money are won from, you're putting the ideas in my head by saying why not.
[26.04.2017 05:24:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is calling it when someone is partially afk
[26.04.2017 05:25:15] SpyJay_YT: Gde I can't make it offical if the battle started already tho?
[26.04.2017 05:25:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is when someone has a technical issue
[26.04.2017 05:25:28] God_Doesnt_Exist: right it can only be called after
[26.04.2017 05:25:47] SpyJay_YT: Gde, I won't do that
[26.04.2017 05:25:49] SpyJay_YT: I promise
[26.04.2017 05:26:26] SpyJay_YT: If I see that both competitors are ready, no one afk or holding still odly, I'll make it offical,
[26.04.2017 05:26:29] SpyJay_YT: but
[26.04.2017 05:26:41] SpyJay_YT: if they just pause in the middle of a fight
[26.04.2017 05:26:45] SpyJay_YT: I can't control that
[26.04.2017 05:27:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: im not asking you to control that
[26.04.2017 05:27:11] SpyJay_YT: Ik
[26.04.2017 05:27:13] SpyJay_YT: Im js
[26.04.2017 05:27:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: it has nothing to do with controlling that idk why you even brought that up
[26.04.2017 05:27:16] SpyJay_YT: incase it happens
[26.04.2017 05:27:26] SpyJay_YT: I was js
[26.04.2017 05:27:40] SpyJay_YT: Gde, I won't let you down.
[26.04.2017 05:28:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: alright i MAY allow it
[26.04.2017 05:28:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: ask me again tomorrow
[26.04.2017 05:28:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: im not convinced yet
[26.04.2017 05:28:42] SpyJay_YT: Ok
[26.04.2017 05:28:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: but your argument is favorable
[26.04.2017 05:28:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: so ask me tomorrow

[26.04.2017 05:29:56] SpyJay_YT: im asking HOW
[26.04.2017 05:30:00] SpyJay_YT: is it favorable
[26.04.2017 05:30:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: the words
[26.04.2017 05:30:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: are
[26.04.2017 05:31:13] SpyJay_YT: hmm
[26.04.2017 05:31:19] SpyJay_YT: I kinda understand now
[26.04.2017 05:31:21] SpyJay_YT: ok
[26.04.2017 05:31:32] SpyJay_YT: Like
[26.04.2017 05:31:39] SpyJay_YT: It's showing
[26.04.2017 05:31:48] SpyJay_YT: worthiness? or should be approved
[26.04.2017 05:31:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes you could define it as such
[26.04.2017 05:32:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: so yeah thats the gist
[26.04.2017 05:32:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: ask me tomorrow
[26.04.2017 05:32:56] SpyJay_YT: Ok
[26.04.2017 05:32:57] SpyJay_YT: gn

[27.04.2017 01:27:34] _Vigilance_: Wait, God_Doesnt_Exist, what if you had a police force, and a main gang? The gang would be the opposite of the police force, they would all be evil n shit and spread crime, so there would be 2 opposite forces, sparking RP
[27.04.2017 01:27:35] Razara_Cheshire: don't you give me that dumb excuse. I don't believe it for a second

[27.04.2017 01:39:56] Razara_Cheshire: How would you like it if we took your stuff and used it to destroy your base for no reason?
[27.04.2017 01:40:01] Waggity: 4 stacks of gold
[27.04.2017 01:40:02] _Vigilance_: So God_Doesnt_Exist, how about that Good/Bad idea?
[27.04.2017 01:40:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: raz

[27.04.2017 01:42:00] Razara_Cheshire: Why couldn't you have just destroyed Tony and leave my faction alone?
[27.04.2017 01:42:04] _Vigilance_: What should our fac name be?
[27.04.2017 01:42:05] Waggity: Im not a Bad guy or a Good guy
[27.04.2017 01:42:11] Waggity: Im neutral

[27.04.2017 01:42:43] Archieous: They can remain neutral
[27.04.2017 01:42:45] Archieous: Undecided
[27.04.2017 01:42:47] _Vigilance_: They chose to be a mortal and be safe from murder
[27.04.2017 01:42:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: and what happens to undecided people?

[27.04.2017 01:43:12] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: with anyone?
[27.04.2017 01:43:16] Archieous: Undecided people could buy guns
[27.04.2017 01:43:19] HerpaDerp10000: thats a bad idea
[27.04.2017 01:43:23] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:23] HerpaDerp10000: its dumb
[27.04.2017 01:43:25] _Vigilance_: Villains: Kill Heroes | Heroes: Kill Villains | Neutrals: Can't pvp
[27.04.2017 01:43:25] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:27] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:28] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:29] Waggity: Razara is finally catching on
[27.04.2017 01:43:35] _Vigilance_: Villains: Kill Heroes | Heroes: Kill Villains | Neutrals: Can't pvp
[27.04.2017 01:43:38] Razara_Cheshire: I have been saying that
[27.04.2017 01:43:41] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:49] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire that already happens
[27.04.2017 01:43:55] Waggity: Ill pvp for sure
[27.04.2017 01:43:59] HerpaDerp10000: that should be a minigame duh
[27.04.2017 01:44:07] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire ppl can already become op and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:44:10] Razara_Cheshire: I know. Having a full team of evil people doing it is worse though
[27.04.2017 01:44:11] Waggity: I fight weak heroes
[27.04.2017 01:44:22] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire that can happen any time
[27.04.2017 01:44:22] Waggity: Like that kid "Percy Jackson"
[27.04.2017 01:44:29] Archieous: lol
[27.04.2017 01:44:42] Razara_Cheshire: Having a team of people doing it is worse
[27.04.2017 01:44:45] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire we could take all the ops's and kill everyone as it is right now
[27.04.2017 01:45:12] Razara_Cheshire: I don't care. You destroyed my faction. If you had waited, Tony probably would have been kicked out of it
[27.04.2017 01:45:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: i'm rejecting your idea.
[27.04.2017 01:45:18] Razara_Cheshire: Tony is a dick

[27.04.2017 01:46:19] Waggity: Dark Heroes
[27.04.2017 01:46:28] Razara_Cheshire: I like mine better. You're no heroes
[27.04.2017 01:46:41] _Vigilance_: Ben
[27.04.2017 01:46:42] Waggity: We save people
[27.04.2017 01:46:48] _Vigilance_: I have an Axe
[27.04.2017 01:46:59] Archieous: okay
[27.04.2017 01:47:00] Razara_Cheshire: YEAH CERTAINLY SAVED ME WHEN YOU DESTROYED MY BASE AND KILLED ME
[27.04.2017 01:47:05] Waggity: We should name our faction Dark Heroes
[27.04.2017 01:47:09] Waggity: Yup
[27.04.2017 01:47:17] Razara_Cheshire: I hate you
[27.04.2017 01:47:18] Waggity: We saved it from happening later
[27.04.2017 01:47:24] _Vigilance_: Wait, why dont we change the name to: "The Mercenaries"
[27.04.2017 01:47:25] Razara_Cheshire: ...
[27.04.2017 01:47:36] _Vigilance_: We should be The Mercenaries
[27.04.2017 01:47:44] Waggity: Yeah
[27.04.2017 01:47:45] _Vigilance_: Because we're neutral
[27.04.2017 01:47:54] Waggity: Nice
[27.04.2017 01:48:00] _Vigilance_: we will fight if paid, and we do what we want

[27.04.2017 01:48:08] Archieous: Now we make power faster
[27.04.2017 01:48:09] Waggity: Nice
[27.04.2017 01:48:10] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, how many plots do you think it'll take to replicate a base like that?
[27.04.2017 01:48:28] Waggity: Lets plan our next attack
[27.04.2017 01:48:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: plots?
[27.04.2017 01:48:30] _Vigilance_: We dont even need a base, we just need one thing... I'll set it up in a sec

[27.04.2017 01:48:48] Razara_Cheshire: If we make it on plots, they literally can't break it
[27.04.2017 01:48:57] Archieous: Your base was 8 chucks
[27.04.2017 01:49:05] Archieous: But we took away 3
[27.04.2017 01:49:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats true powergirl you should be able to do it in 2 plots
[27.04.2017 01:49:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: 4 would look the best tho
[27.04.2017 01:49:25] Razara_Cheshire: Thanks. I'll mail Camull about it

[27.04.2017 04:41:50] _Vigilance_: My friend has hacked games with his rooted tablet :P
[27.04.2017 04:41:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: rooting unlocks ur phone so itsnot locked down by the manufacturer
[27.04.2017 04:42:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: like theres apps and shit on ur phone u cant uninstall
[27.04.2017 04:42:12] Bitslane: oh okay
[27.04.2017 04:42:13] _Vigilance_: Idk if I should root my phone
[27.04.2017 04:42:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: but rooting would allow you to delete them
[27.04.2017 04:42:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: to a degree
[27.04.2017 04:42:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: you can also install adblockers
[27.04.2017 04:42:32] _Vigilance_: because it might mess up my mom's parental thing and cause her to flip out
[27.04.2017 04:42:36] Bitslane: just sounds like a waste of time
[27.04.2017 04:42:37] HerpaDerp10000: 1 free in app purchases 2 change the interface 3 more apps 4 modify ur apps boost things and etc
[27.04.2017 04:42:52] _Vigilance_: ;-; I want to root it ;-;

[27.04.2017 04:43:24] _Vigilance_: But it will probably fuck with my mom's parental setup and she'll flip out so I probably cant D:
[27.04.2017 04:43:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: i wouldn't advise it
[27.04.2017 04:43:39] _Vigilance_: Sad D:
[27.04.2017 04:43:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: the reason why i like the nexus 5 is because its the only phone that actually doesnt come locked down
[27.04.2017 04:44:03] Bitslane: I could care less about that
[27.04.2017 04:44:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: ik
[27.04.2017 04:44:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: rooting is pretty worthless, herpa wasn't able to asnwer my questions
[27.04.2017 04:44:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: ppl like to claim its the best thing ever, but its not really that great

[27.04.2017 20:52:56] ThatCraftLife: it was _Vigilance_ who destroyed it
[27.04.2017 20:53:00] Razara_Cheshire: And for the last time, bringing people trying to destroy the base into the base is not helping anyone

[27.04.2017 20:55:51] ThatCraftLife: can i declare you guys as enemy and kill TonyBongos alot so I get power for my fac
[27.04.2017 20:55:56] TonyBongos: I never meant for any of this to happen

[30.04.2017 00:42:59] Camulll: harley
[30.04.2017 00:43:01] ImUnicornRainbow: That way the people who join that arent interested in super heroes or creative can focus on another world.
[30.04.2017 00:43:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats because those servers are using multiple servers
[30.04.2017 00:43:11] Wolfie35: Camulll

[30.04.2017 06:52:19] _Vigilance_: ye
[30.04.2017 06:52:24] _Vigilance_: take me back?
[30.04.2017 06:52:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay
[30.04.2017 06:53:33] _Vigilance_: lol the magic door that takes you to a magical space land
[30.04.2017 06:53:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: aka my office
[30.04.2017 06:53:40] God_Doesnt_Exist: lol
[30.04.2017 06:53:58] _Vigilance_: Also make this a 3x3 platform so ppl dont fall off when there's multiple (if you want)
[30.04.2017 06:54:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: meetings are only ever 1 at a time and i have collisions disabed
[30.04.2017 06:54:31] _Vigilance_: o
[30.04.2017 06:54:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: ppl cant push each other
[30.04.2017 06:54:34] _Vigilance_: still smol
[30.04.2017 06:54:38] God_Doesnt_Exist: its supposed to be
[30.04.2017 06:54:39] _Vigilance_: plus it's on a star
[30.04.2017 06:54:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: this is for meetings not for ppl running around
[30.04.2017 06:54:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: so it keeps their attention on the meeting
[30.04.2017 06:54:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: since they can't move
[30.04.2017 06:55:12] _Vigilance_: makes sense
[30.04.2017 06:55:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: this turned out really good tho
[30.04.2017 06:56:12] _Vigilance_: ye
[30.04.2017 06:56:15] _Vigilance_: proud of you!
[30.04.2017 06:56:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: i wonder if i should make one giant planet in the background
[30.04.2017 06:56:35] _Vigilance_: if only we could remove clouds
[30.04.2017 06:56:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: ikr
[30.04.2017 06:56:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: like a radius of 250
[30.04.2017 06:56:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: er diameter
[30.04.2017 06:56:56] _Vigilance_: you could make it like down below-ish
[30.04.2017 06:57:00] God_Doesnt_Exist: i mean like behind
[30.04.2017 06:57:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: like we're in orbit around a planet
[30.04.2017 06:57:13] God_Doesnt_Exist: like how big u see the earth from the ISS
[30.04.2017 06:57:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: like how big u see the earth from the ISS
[30.04.2017 06:57:44] _Vigilance_: it could be like right down there
[30.04.2017 06:57:50] _Vigilance_: to my bottom left
[30.04.2017 06:58:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: i dont think it would look good tho cuz rendering distance would just show bits of it
[30.04.2017 06:58:04] _Vigilance_: or up above us
[30.04.2017 06:58:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: instead of getting the whole sphere
[30.04.2017 06:58:10] _Vigilance_: how about right there
[30.04.2017 06:58:16] _Vigilance_: or there
[30.04.2017 06:58:32] _Vigilance_: somewhere above, making the player feel small
[30.04.2017 06:59:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: it sadly fucks up lightning really bad to put huge sheets of material of u
[30.04.2017 06:59:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: over u*
[30.04.2017 06:59:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: or that would be awesome
[30.04.2017 06:59:25] _Vigilance_: aw
[30.04.2017 06:59:34] _Vigilance_: how about behind or something
[30.04.2017 06:59:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: i'd love to put like a reverse landscape above us, like an inverted city from doctor strange or inception
[30.04.2017 06:59:51] _Vigilance_: idk put it whever you want
[30.04.2017 06:59:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: but the shadows would be awful i tried once
[30.04.2017 07:00:10] _Vigilance_: Yeah make it seem like the ground was above us
[30.04.2017 07:00:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: exatly
[30.04.2017 07:00:18] God_Doesnt_Exist: that would be awesome
[30.04.2017 07:00:28] God_Doesnt_Exist: i wish bro
[30.04.2017 07:00:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: fuckin lighting stuff
[30.04.2017 07:00:34] _Vigilance_: if torches could be hung down it would look pretty cool at night if lighting could be changed that way
[30.04.2017 07:00:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: hell yeah
[30.04.2017 07:01:20] God_Doesnt_Exist: i guarantee you minecraft 2 will probs be the best game of all time
[30.04.2017 07:01:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: best selling*
[30.04.2017 07:01:46] _Vigilance_: I knind of understand why they'd make a 2
[30.04.2017 07:01:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: kind of?
[30.04.2017 07:02:00] _Vigilance_: If you make MC 2, everyone with mc has to rebuy it so more $$$
[30.04.2017 07:02:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah
[30.04.2017 07:02:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: plus you rebuild it on a new engine
[30.04.2017 07:02:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: one with infinite build heights
[30.04.2017 07:02:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: etc etc
[30.04.2017 07:02:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: true API
[30.04.2017 07:02:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: if you think microsoft isn't investing as much energy as possible into developing minecraft 2, ur crazy
[30.04.2017 07:03:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: evernyually MC2 will be out
[30.04.2017 07:03:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: i have high hopes
[30.04.2017 07:03:24] _Vigilance_: C'ya there :P
[30.04.2017 07:03:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: i mean even xbox 360 had a minecraft clone
[30.04.2017 07:03:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: that had infinite buid height
[30.04.2017 07:03:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: fuckin xbox360
[30.04.2017 07:03:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: imagine imfinite build height tho
[30.04.2017 07:04:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: it would be ridic
[30.04.2017 07:04:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: i was watching my friend play the game and he was going to his base underground
[30.04.2017 07:04:28] _Vigilance_: next year doh, this year I want to pre-order battlefront 2
[30.04.2017 07:04:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: and he gets to this hole in the ground and jumps
[30.04.2017 07:04:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: and falls. and falls. and falls. he fell like 10,000 blocks and landed in water and was like "theres my base" i was like WAAATTT
[30.04.2017 07:04:55] _Vigilance_: lol
[30.04.2017 07:05:04] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats fuckin xbox 360 imagine if MINECRAFT coul do that
[30.04.2017 07:05:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: i would shit in my own mouth on cam
[30.04.2017 07:05:24] _Vigilance_: haha
[30.04.2017 07:05:29] _Vigilance_: lissa would love that
[30.04.2017 07:05:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: i will never shut this server down until MC 2 comes out
[30.04.2017 07:05:51] _Vigilance_: Imagine the lag doh.. if you built a big structure with world edit and made it almost infinite
[30.04.2017 07:06:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: what do you mean by lag?
[30.04.2017 07:06:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: its not really lag, just CPU usage
[30.04.2017 07:06:23] _Vigilance_: It could kill some ppl...
[30.04.2017 07:06:35] _Vigilance_: I downloaded a world with a shit ton of blocks and couldnt get in to it
[30.04.2017 07:06:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats different than worldediting something
[30.04.2017 07:06:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: worldedit goes though block by block and places stuff
[30.04.2017 07:07:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: loading a world loads all that shit at once
[30.04.2017 07:07:32] _Vigilance_: but then every time you come back on it it would kill you
[30.04.2017 07:07:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: no because thats the beauty of it
[30.04.2017 07:07:50] God_Doesnt_Exist: you see with minecraft
[30.04.2017 07:07:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: it loads in chunks
[30.04.2017 07:07:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: from bedrock to sky
[30.04.2017 07:08:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: in a 16x16 area
[30.04.2017 07:08:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: but with infinite build height
[30.04.2017 07:08:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: you simply limit how high you render stuff...so stuff above say...200+ blocks is not visible
[30.04.2017 07:08:41] _Vigilance_: it would load 16x16x16 maybe>
[30.04.2017 07:08:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: that way if you're in a tower that's 10,0000 blocks tall, you only render the 200 near you
[30.04.2017 07:08:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: so it doesnt crash the clients
[30.04.2017 07:08:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats how the xbox one did it
[30.04.2017 07:09:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: minecraft loads chunks poorly
[30.04.2017 07:09:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: it could be optimized some
[30.04.2017 07:09:34] _Vigilance_: Couldn't they fix that in an update?
[30.04.2017 07:10:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: the could, but its one of those things that's literally part of the core of the game. changing that would probably affect so much other stuff at this point it's probs literally easier to make a new game
[30.04.2017 07:10:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: its the same reason why boats weren't fixed for so long, cuz it was embedded as part of the movement scheme
[30.04.2017 07:11:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: and movement was so baked into the core it was difficult to fix, let alone completely overhaul like we're talking about with inf build height
[30.04.2017 07:12:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: there used to be a project called Cubic Chunks that did exactly what i'm describing, but it's defunct now
[30.04.2017 07:12:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: you can read about it here, super interesting, you learn alot of stuff from this post http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-discussion/suggestions/77631-cubic-chunks-reduced-lag-infinite-height-and-more
[30.04.2017 07:15:05] _Vigilance_: internet died
[30.04.2017 07:15:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: u fucking fuck
[30.04.2017 07:15:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: i typed out 1999999 pages
[30.04.2017 07:15:23] _Vigilance_: ?
[30.04.2017 07:15:32] _Vigilance_: I saw all the core coding stuff
[30.04.2017 07:15:40] God_Doesnt_Exist: did you see the link to cubic chunks
[30.04.2017 07:15:46] _Vigilance_: no
[30.04.2017 07:15:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: there used to be a project called Cubic Chunks that did exactly what i'm describing, but it's defunct now
[30.04.2017 07:16:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: you can read about it here, super interesting, you learn alot of stuff from this post http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-discussion/suggestions/77631-cubic-chunks-reduced-lag-infinite-height-and-more
[30.04.2017 07:16:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: brb going to microwave a fatass burrito
[30.04.2017 07:16:19] _Vigilance_: fastfood mm
[30.04.2017 07:17:24] _Vigilance_: Atleast make the end infinite bc building in to space
[30.04.2017 07:19:47] _Vigilance_: It says there is a limit though
[30.04.2017 07:25:11] _Vigilance_: So CPU usage spikes happen when loading chunks because youre going all the way up and down
[30.04.2017 07:25:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: no
[30.04.2017 07:25:38] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats incorrect
[30.04.2017 07:25:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: it only renders a set bubble around ur char
[30.04.2017 07:25:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: and ur right, theres is a technical vertical limit
[30.04.2017 07:25:58] _Vigilance_: I thought the current method loaded all the way down
[30.04.2017 07:25:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: just like minecraft worlds aren't truly infinite
[30.04.2017 07:26:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes that is the current method but the updated method doesnt
[30.04.2017 07:26:14] _Vigilance_: Why would there be a technical limit?
[30.04.2017 07:26:26] God_Doesnt_Exist: because computers only have so much RAM and disk space they can't truly be infinite
[30.04.2017 07:26:38] _Vigilance_: makes sense
[30.04.2017 07:26:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: but fucking 30 million above and below bedrock is fucking basically infinite
[30.04.2017 07:27:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: 60 fucking million build height
[30.04.2017 07:27:06] _Vigilance_: One thing I found cool was memory = weight, so the more memory you have taken up on your phone or what not the heavier it gets slightly
[30.04.2017 07:27:24] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats true but only on the smallest most technical scale
[30.04.2017 07:27:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: immeasurable
[30.04.2017 07:27:51] _Vigilance_: but cool still
[30.04.2017 07:28:13] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah i think thats very fascinating
[30.04.2017 07:28:52] _Vigilance_: Does that mean our brains would get heavier? (Is that why they get bigger?)
[30.04.2017 07:29:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: well, i thinkkkkkkkkkkk
[30.04.2017 07:29:18] God_Doesnt_Exist: from my understanding
[30.04.2017 07:29:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: the reason why RAM increases in weight is because it uses voltage to determine 1's and 0's
[30.04.2017 07:29:37] _Vigilance_: They get bigger to make more space
[30.04.2017 07:29:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: which change the mass-energy in the system
[30.04.2017 07:29:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: they get ... bigger?
[30.04.2017 07:30:02] _Vigilance_: brains
[30.04.2017 07:30:04] God_Doesnt_Exist: oh
[30.04.2017 07:30:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes that's very true for brains
[30.04.2017 07:30:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: the bigger somethig is the more mass it has (compared to its smaller self)
[30.04.2017 07:30:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: dont confuse that with density
[30.04.2017 07:30:50] _Vigilance_: ye density is how much matter is inside it
[30.04.2017 07:31:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: i dont think brains get heavier if the brain doesnt get bigger, even if we know more
[30.04.2017 07:31:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: just like hard drives dont weigh more with more weight
[30.04.2017 07:31:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: just CPUs and RAM is affected by this i think
[30.04.2017 07:31:46] _Vigilance_: But isn't it growing connections inside?
[30.04.2017 07:31:54] _Vigilance_: If you learn more
[30.04.2017 07:32:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: well if its growing connections, then it's physically increasing in size
[30.04.2017 07:32:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: i was talking about a brain thats not increasing in size
[30.04.2017 07:32:17] _Vigilance_: oh, ye
[30.04.2017 07:32:29] _Vigilance_: Would an electrical charge have any mass though?
[30.04.2017 07:32:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes! :D definitely
[30.04.2017 07:32:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: an object's weight is not just its mass, but its the mass-energy state of the system
[30.04.2017 07:33:12] _Vigilance_: Like, if RAM is being charged, would that be like connections happening in the brain?
[30.04.2017 07:33:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: well, with the brain, connects are made with tissue like neurons and synapses and axons
[30.04.2017 07:33:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: but with ram nothing physical grows, its ONLY electrical
[30.04.2017 07:34:04] _Vigilance_: but you said electricity has mass
[30.04.2017 07:34:22] _Vigilance_: So if it's gaining more electricity, it's gaining more mass?
[30.04.2017 07:34:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay, i'm going to base my explanation off of current known science (as far as i know)
[30.04.2017 07:34:50] God_Doesnt_Exist: theb rain does not require more electricity to learn/store more information, therefore the total electricity in the brain system is the same
[30.04.2017 07:35:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: with ram, in order to have a 1 or a 0, a 1 means +5 volt, a 0 is no volt
[30.04.2017 07:35:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: so a RAM stick where all bits are flipped to 1 is heavier than all bits flipped to 0
[30.04.2017 07:35:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: because its requiring energy to make all those bits 1
[30.04.2017 07:35:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats my understanding
[30.04.2017 07:35:49] Zero148: Never join that mc.roleplay.com server again
[30.04.2017 07:35:52] _Vigilance_: But if it's gaining voltage (which has mass) woudln't it be gaining more mass as well 'growing'?
[30.04.2017 07:35:56] Zero148: Or something like that
[30.04.2017 07:35:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: why not black racer?
[30.04.2017 07:36:06] Zero148: They banned Camu
[30.04.2017 07:36:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: are you talking about the brain or the ram stick ?
[30.04.2017 07:36:20] God_Doesnt_Exist: that sux BR
[30.04.2017 07:36:20] _Vigilance_: Ram
[30.04.2017 07:36:26] Zero148: and when I went to settle things
[30.04.2017 07:36:28] Zero148: Tooo
[30.04.2017 07:36:30] Zero148: unban her
[30.04.2017 07:36:32] Zero148: xD
[30.04.2017 07:36:37] _Vigilance_: and got banned?
[30.04.2017 07:36:40] Zero148: The owner gave 1 option
[30.04.2017 07:36:44] Zero148: and that option
[30.04.2017 07:36:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: it's not actually gaining MASS, it's gaining energy, which adds to how much it weighs
[30.04.2017 07:36:58] _Vigilance_: If it's 1, it's not an option
[30.04.2017 07:37:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: so its not really correct to say it "adds mass" but it does "increas how much it weighs"
[30.04.2017 07:37:14] Zero148: was like telling someone to almost kill theirselves while hanging and killing their family
[30.04.2017 07:37:17] Zero148: was like telling someone to almost kill theirselves while hanging and killing their family
[30.04.2017 07:37:25] _Vigilance_: , o I thought you said energy had mass
[30.04.2017 07:37:30] Zero148: The option was, if I remember correcytly
[30.04.2017 07:37:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: i didnt know how technical you wanted to be vig
[30.04.2017 07:37:39] Zero148: correctly*
[30.04.2017 07:37:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: i was incorrect when i said that
[30.04.2017 07:38:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: like u know the formula E=mc^2?
[30.04.2017 07:38:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: well thats actually only half the formula
[30.04.2017 07:38:31] Zero148: 1.Getting 8 active players to join that server 2. Never spam again 3. Be always active on THAT server
[30.04.2017 07:38:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: the other half deals with the very tiny, small amount of "momentum" that energy carries
[30.04.2017 07:38:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: energy can have momentum but not mass, its very counter-intuitive
[30.04.2017 07:38:44] Zero148: 4. Advertise that server on this server
[30.04.2017 07:38:51] _Vigilance_: das weird
[30.04.2017 07:38:54] Zero148: And remember
[30.04.2017 07:38:57] Zero148: all those 4
[30.04.2017 07:39:02] Zero148: were in the only 1 option
[30.04.2017 07:39:10] Zero148: -.-

[30.04.2017 07:39:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: better than i can explain
[30.04.2017 07:39:28] God_Doesnt_Exist: well i dont like the roleplaymc.us server
[30.04.2017 07:39:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: so i wont go there anyway
[30.04.2017 07:39:44] Zero148: I am still gonna try to settle things
[30.04.2017 07:40:01] Zero148: Im not the type to drop the gun after 1 shot
[30.04.2017 07:40:29] Zero148: I have a good offensive arguement
[30.04.2017 07:40:42] Zero148: *offensive statement
[30.04.2017 07:40:48] _Vigilance_: What if you only have 1 bullet?
[30.04.2017 07:41:09] Zero148: There are over 100 options you could do when someone has a gun to your head
[30.04.2017 07:41:24] Zero148: Same with when you have 1 bullet left
[30.04.2017 07:41:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: i love physcs so fucking much, i was a phys major before i switched to computer science
[30.04.2017 07:41:39] _Vigilance_: There's a lot because you could always be moving your arms in different direction
[30.04.2017 07:41:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: i couldn't handle the advanced math courses
[30.04.2017 07:41:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: D:
[30.04.2017 07:41:50] _Vigilance_: Algebra chapter 10 sux
[30.04.2017 07:42:02] Zero148: I hate amth
[30.04.2017 07:42:04] Zero148: math
[30.04.2017 07:42:08] Zero148: geography
[30.04.2017 07:42:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: i had to take calc 1 , 2 and 3 and i failed out of multivariable calc 2 times so i switched majors
[30.04.2017 07:42:41] _Vigilance_: Geography wasnt bad
[30.04.2017 07:42:43] Zero148: I wish cancer to my chemics teacher
[30.04.2017 07:42:45] _Vigilance_: History isnt
[30.04.2017 07:42:56] Zero148: What are you guys talkin about actually
[30.04.2017 07:42:58] _Vigilance_: I kinda know the elements we need to know
[30.04.2017 07:43:01] Zero148: Im talkin bout real life
[30.04.2017 07:43:23] Zero148: I have a few people I wish cancer to
[30.04.2017 07:43:28] _Vigilance_: We were talking about how devices gain weight when they get more data
[30.04.2017 07:43:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah
[30.04.2017 07:43:49] Zero148: thats the same as
[30.04.2017 07:43:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: i am a huge nerd for anything technical and sciencey...he started talking and i went on a typing rampage
[30.04.2017 07:43:59] Zero148: paper weighing more when written on it
[30.04.2017 07:44:11] Zero148: Its logical
[30.04.2017 07:44:13] God_Doesnt_Exist: i ove talking space, physics, and math when i can handle it
[30.04.2017 07:44:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: and computers of course
[30.04.2017 07:44:24] Zero148: neeeeerd
[30.04.2017 07:44:25] Zero148: jk
[30.04.2017 07:44:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: that love for shit like that allows me to run my own business...i highly recommend you also become a nerd so you can sit on your ass playing minecraft and get paid like me, then you won't make fun
[30.04.2017 07:44:59] _Vigilance_: if a tomato is a fruit, is ketchup a jelly?
[30.04.2017 07:45:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: oh dude
[30.04.2017 07:45:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: um
[30.04.2017 07:45:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: what was it
[30.04.2017 07:45:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: strawberries
[30.04.2017 07:45:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: are like a vegetable or something
[30.04.2017 07:45:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: not a berry
[30.04.2017 07:45:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: cuz of the seeds
[30.04.2017 07:45:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: something about having the seends on the outside of it makes it a different kind of plant
[30.04.2017 07:45:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: i forget now
[30.04.2017 07:45:38] _Vigilance_: but veggies have seeds on the inside
[30.04.2017 07:45:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: i cant remember what t is
[30.04.2017 07:45:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: all i know is its something weird

[30.04.2017 07:48:07] _Vigilance_: isnt it around now?
[30.04.2017 07:48:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: o idk
[30.04.2017 07:48:13] Zero148: Oooh you talkin bout Potterworlddddd
[30.04.2017 07:48:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: i logged off of potterwurl
[30.04.2017 07:48:15] _Vigilance_: Ask Lissa lmao
[30.04.2017 07:48:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: she in bed in da nude again
[30.04.2017 07:48:25] _Vigilance_: fak
[30.04.2017 07:48:29] _Vigilance_: she failed us dude
[30.04.2017 07:48:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: might have to go plow dat shit soon tho
[30.04.2017 07:48:35] Zero148: I left Potterworld
[30.04.2017 07:48:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: idk
[30.04.2017 07:48:37] _Vigilance_: brb
[30.04.2017 07:48:45] God_Doesnt_Exist: i'm year 3 almost 4
[30.04.2017 07:49:00] Zero148: I was year 1 on another server the same as potterworld
[30.04.2017 07:49:09] _Vigilance_: it's in an hour
[30.04.2017 07:49:16] Zero148: fk potterworld
[30.04.2017 07:49:58] _Vigilance_: Potterworld gets Tek building ideas
[30.04.2017 07:50:24] _Vigilance_: OMG Tek, rember when justicecraft (or whatever) came on here and started harassing everyone?
[30.04.2017 07:50:34] Zero148: WHUT
[30.04.2017 07:50:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: which time?
[30.04.2017 07:50:39] Zero148: I KNOW JUSTICECRAFT XD
[30.04.2017 07:50:40] _Vigilance_: LMAO
[30.04.2017 07:50:43] Zero148: I am Mxy on there xD
[30.04.2017 07:50:49] Zero148: thats why I got a mxy skin
[30.04.2017 07:50:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: what powers does mxy have on there?
[30.04.2017 07:51:03] Zero148: Shit powers
[30.04.2017 07:51:05] Zero148: Literally
[30.04.2017 07:51:08] Zero148: Fucking shit powers
[30.04.2017 07:51:13] God_Doesnt_Exist: what are they
[30.04.2017 07:51:14] Zero148: I apparently cant hit darkseid
[30.04.2017 07:51:24] Zero148: I got a gun named eldritch blast
[30.04.2017 07:51:31] Zero148: a normal blast
[30.04.2017 07:51:33] _Vigilance_: he can do anything (to people in the current time period)
[30.04.2017 07:51:38] _Vigilance_: (and dimension)
[30.04.2017 07:51:56] Zero148: I didnt even get a combat weapon

[30.04.2017 07:52:09] Zero148: by*
[30.04.2017 07:52:10] _Vigilance_: He doesnt really fight
[30.04.2017 07:52:16] Zero148: Like
[30.04.2017 07:52:21] Zero148: on JusticeCraft
[30.04.2017 07:52:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: so this server is better than JC?
[30.04.2017 07:52:23] _Vigilance_: He just fucks with superman

[30.04.2017 07:52:36] Zero148: You ask me that?

[30.04.2017 07:53:30] Zero148: Justicecraft:
[30.04.2017 07:53:39] Zero148: +Apllying to know if one has experience
[30.04.2017 07:53:47] _Vigilance_: faking Bitslane made it so I wasnt the oldest player still playing
[30.04.2017 07:54:00] Zero148: +People are friendly
[30.04.2017 07:54:08] _Vigilance_: LOL People here are assholes
[30.04.2017 07:54:08] Zero148: +Active players
[30.04.2017 07:54:16] _Vigilance_: We do have active ppl doh
[30.04.2017 07:54:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: twincrafters29 is longer player than you, he plays infrequently but sometimes
[30.04.2017 07:54:23] Zero148: Shh I said first jc then this
[30.04.2017 07:54:28] God_Doesnt_Exist: same with baconboyx10
[30.04.2017 07:54:43] _Vigilance_: twincrafters29 and baconboyx10 can kill themselves
[30.04.2017 07:54:49] Zero148: stfu
[30.04.2017 07:54:51] Zero148: im talkin
[30.04.2017 07:54:52] Zero148: xD
[30.04.2017 07:54:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: but
[30.04.2017 07:54:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: besides them
[30.04.2017 07:55:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: ur the oldest
[30.04.2017 07:55:07] _Vigilance_: I've never seen them D:<
[30.04.2017 07:55:15] Zero148: +Taken list and recommended list
[30.04.2017 07:55:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: they dont play often
[30.04.2017 07:55:24] God_Doesnt_Exist: just once every few weeks
[30.04.2017 07:55:36] Zero148: -Powers arent really balanced
[30.04.2017 07:55:48] _Vigilance_: Our players arn't nice because there are no rules about niceness
[30.04.2017 07:55:50] God_Doesnt_Exist: im reading what u say Zero148
[30.04.2017 07:55:58] Zero148: -Must wait long till powers are amde
[30.04.2017 07:56:00] Zero148: *made
[30.04.2017 07:56:33] _Vigilance_: plus there's so much crap you can do to piss people off in this server
[30.04.2017 07:56:38] Zero148: -Admins/Mods/Owners dont care if you want better powers
[30.04.2017 07:56:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: Zero148
[30.04.2017 07:57:01] Zero148: -Not many roleplays are happening there
[30.04.2017 07:57:10] _Vigilance_: one day I will be the oldest player still here!
[30.04.2017 07:57:19] Zero148: This server:
[30.04.2017 07:57:33] Zero148: +Many many available characters
[30.04.2017 07:57:52] _Vigilance_: +More variety of characters
[30.04.2017 07:57:55] Zero148: brb
[30.04.2017 07:58:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: you should know that this server was not born with some grand idea. this server has 1 main goal and 1 main goal only (for right now): to make as many heroes as possible with matching feats
[30.04.2017 07:58:14] _Vigilance_: Assassins Creed is a fun game!
[30.04.2017 07:58:42] _Vigilance_: I wish I had an official character :(
[30.04.2017 07:59:08] _Vigilance_: I want a speedster with green lightning who is also a mercenary
[30.04.2017 07:59:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: This server was born because one day I was playing survival and I said "it would be cool if i had superman powers right now"
[30.04.2017 07:59:55] _Vigilance_: I basically want a cross between the hulk the flash and deadshot/deathstroke (but not hulk strength) :P
[30.04.2017 07:59:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: so i made superman
[30.04.2017 07:59:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: then i made hulk
[30.04.2017 08:00:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: then wonder woman then idk
[30.04.2017 08:00:28] God_Doesnt_Exist: then i thought
[30.04.2017 08:00:33] _Vigilance_: I wish we had another world like roleplaymc has where you can make up your own backstory and pick non op powers and roleplay :P
[30.04.2017 08:01:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats interesting
[30.04.2017 08:01:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: that intrigues me
[30.04.2017 08:01:26] _Vigilance_: what does? Your story or the thing I said?
[30.04.2017 08:01:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: the thing you said
[30.04.2017 08:01:40] _Vigilance_: o
[30.04.2017 08:02:18] God_Doesnt_Exist: how do you choose your powers?
[30.04.2017 08:02:20] _Vigilance_: well on roleplaymc they have like 4 things, 1: Marvel rp shit, 2: DC rp shit, 3: Make up a backstory & pick powers and rp shit, 3: some god shit thing
[30.04.2017 08:02:32] _Vigilance_: all split up
[30.04.2017 08:02:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah its really confusing
[30.04.2017 08:02:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: i been there
[30.04.2017 08:02:50] _Vigilance_: idk, because SpyJay says he wont tell me when it's open to the public
[30.04.2017 08:03:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: hm
[30.04.2017 08:03:24] Zero148: Im back
[30.04.2017 08:03:51] Zero148: alright
[30.04.2017 08:03:53] Zero148: lets see
[30.04.2017 08:03:55] _Vigilance_: You could have secretaries setup an application process where you get a book with a format in it and questions like: "Pick 3 of these listed options for the heroe's powers"
[30.04.2017 08:03:57] Zero148: This server:
[30.04.2017 08:04:16] Zero148: +Great info about how to choose a character
[30.04.2017 08:04:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: nah i was thinking a command system
[30.04.2017 08:04:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: so you could just reconfigure your hero at any time
[30.04.2017 08:04:41] _Vigilance_: and so you fill out the custom hero application and they give it to you ( God_Doesnt_Exist ) for review and then you have DNA ENGENEER's code them up or something
[30.04.2017 08:04:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: no
[30.04.2017 08:04:51] _Vigilance_: that works too
[30.04.2017 08:04:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: they woudln't be hard coded
[30.04.2017 08:04:58] Zero148: +Activate players
[30.04.2017 08:05:14] Zero148: +You get helped 8 of the 10 times
[30.04.2017 08:05:43] Zero148: +Great overview of: "Survival
[30.04.2017 08:05:55] Zero148: "Survival" "plots" etc
[30.04.2017 08:06:08] _Vigilance_: "Power Vending Machine" chose up to 3 powers/item traits (guns & stuff like baseball bats & bombs) and then stand in the machine which gives you the permission to run those commands
[30.04.2017 08:06:24] Zero148: +Marvel, Dc, Anime and videogames mixed in 1
[30.04.2017 08:06:30] _Vigilance_: it would be like your hero machine but give out specific powers
[30.04.2017 08:06:41] Zero148: -Not many events
[30.04.2017 08:06:50] _Vigilance_: HEY! We have daily spleef :P
[30.04.2017 08:07:12] Zero148: -Cant really know if someone is an admin/mod/staff/owner or not
[30.04.2017 08:07:17] _Vigilance_: We do fight ckyb too
[30.04.2017 08:07:20] _Vigilance_: club*
[30.04.2017 08:07:35] Zero148: -Character machine isnt a self-service-device
[30.04.2017 08:07:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: i hope this my server develops faster than the other servers, that this server feels more "cutting edge" than the others
[30.04.2017 08:07:54] _Vigilance_: There are no admin/mod's and the owners have bold letters and ALPHA/OMEGA
[30.04.2017 08:08:08] _Vigilance_: roleplaymc?
[30.04.2017 08:08:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: jc or roleplay
[30.04.2017 08:08:51] Zero148: -Players can powerabuse and not known if someone has experience with that character
[30.04.2017 08:08:52] _Vigilance_: if you could open a custom hero world to the public before roleplaymc does that would win over some peeps
[30.04.2017 08:09:11] Zero148: Well ye
[30.04.2017 08:09:19] Zero148: thats about it
[30.04.2017 08:09:29] _Vigilance_: and you could add "Create a custom hero"  to your server adds as well Tek
[30.04.2017 08:09:34] Zero148: Oh also
[30.04.2017 08:09:41] _Vigilance_: That would probably draw in some peeps
[30.04.2017 08:09:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: oh i think i know
[30.04.2017 08:09:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: i got a good idea
[30.04.2017 08:09:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think i know how i can do custom heroes
[30.04.2017 08:09:58] Zero148: +Powers and weapons comes with the character you chose
[30.04.2017 08:10:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: does it have to be in a separate world or can they mingle with normal heroes?
[30.04.2017 08:10:30] Zero148: and another -Survival has a different texture than /warp lab so everytime I tp back and such I gotta wait 10 sec
[30.04.2017 08:10:41] Zero148: for my laptop to settle it
[30.04.2017 08:10:48] _Vigilance_: I would assume you want them to be seperate? They wouldn't be fanfics really, they would be your MC Character WITH powers
[30.04.2017 08:11:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: Zero148 about your comment that the hero machine isne't self serviced, that was changed earlier today
[30.04.2017 08:11:10] Zero148: whut?
[30.04.2017 08:11:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think mixing them is okay
[30.04.2017 08:11:16] Zero148: Its self-serviced now?
[30.04.2017 08:11:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes it is
[30.04.2017 08:11:37] Zero148: I gotta test it 0.0
[30.04.2017 08:11:51] _Vigilance_: If you got your own powers they'd be less op than the ones heroes use i.e no /kill (That could be a staff perk, they could get op powers)
[30.04.2017 08:12:16] _Vigilance_: also custom power ppl wouldn't get tags, they'd get their normal username displayed
[30.04.2017 08:12:33] Zero148: Ooooooh
[30.04.2017 08:12:38] Zero148: Cool
[30.04.2017 08:12:44] Zero148: selfservice
[30.04.2017 08:12:45] _Vigilance_: Tek
[30.04.2017 08:12:53] _Vigilance_: &C there is a problem with self service
[30.04.2017 08:13:10] _Vigilance_: When you use it you get pushed inside the end-rod place and are stuck :P
[30.04.2017 08:13:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: o i used it with no problems
[30.04.2017 08:13:22] Zero148: true
[30.04.2017 08:13:26] God_Doesnt_Exist: i didntknow
[30.04.2017 08:13:28] _Vigilance_: See Zero148?
[30.04.2017 08:13:34] Zero148: Happened to me 2 times now
[30.04.2017 08:13:35] _Vigilance_: Watch Tek
[30.04.2017 08:13:50] _Vigilance_: Watch
[30.04.2017 08:14:02] _Vigilance_: see?
[30.04.2017 08:14:23] _Vigilance_: Maybe drunk xSp4rkz fuckt it
[30.04.2017 08:14:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: i can fix it
[30.04.2017 08:14:57] Zero148: I like how redhood has alot of gadget
[30.04.2017 08:14:58] _Vigilance_: Like, you can warp out, but ppl can also mutate u
[30.04.2017 08:16:05] Zero148: But instead of giving 1 frag gren
[30.04.2017 08:16:11] Zero148: give redhood a stack
[30.04.2017 08:16:30] _Vigilance_: Some custom powers ideas: Flight, Strength (~50), Speed 1-7, Jump 1-6, Guns, Gliders, Resistance 1-2, etc.
[30.04.2017 08:16:44] Zero148: could do
[30.04.2017 08:16:59] Zero148: Want me to write some ideas in a book?
[30.04.2017 08:17:23] _Vigilance_: The three of us should work on: Project: Custom Hero
[30.04.2017 08:17:34] Zero148: Yea
[30.04.2017 08:17:40] Zero148: and Project: Event
[30.04.2017 08:17:53] Zero148: I got some great ideas for events
[30.04.2017 08:18:01] Zero148: We just need some more Capcom characters :>
[30.04.2017 08:18:06] _Vigilance_: ?
[30.04.2017 08:18:08] Zero148: (Marvel vs Capcom)
[30.04.2017 08:18:40] Zero148: and Characters could be seperated in Tier
[30.04.2017 08:18:42] Zero148: tiers
[30.04.2017 08:19:20] Zero148: Street - Enhanced - Mid - Planetary - Cosmic - Titan - Skyfather - Universal - Multiversal - True God
[30.04.2017 08:19:45] _Vigilance_: The funny thing is, the old lab used to separate ppl like that
[30.04.2017 08:19:59] Zero148: Well
[30.04.2017 08:20:01] Zero148: better
[30.04.2017 08:20:22] Zero148: We should add Snake
[30.04.2017 08:20:27] Zero148: and give him guns
[30.04.2017 08:20:34] Zero148: like RHood
[30.04.2017 08:21:04] _Vigilance_: Project: Superhuman
[30.04.2017 08:21:20] _Vigilance_: Where instead of turning players into heroes, we give them powers of their own
[30.04.2017 08:21:27] Zero148: Look
[30.04.2017 08:21:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: perfect
[30.04.2017 08:21:38] God_Doesnt_Exist: I AM A CODING GAWD
[30.04.2017 08:21:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: 1st try
[30.04.2017 08:21:42] Zero148: perfect
[30.04.2017 08:22:01] Zero148: So
[30.04.2017 08:22:03] Zero148: Alph
[30.04.2017 08:22:06] Zero148: Like the idea?
[30.04.2017 08:22:19] Zero148: Project Event and Project CustomHero
[30.04.2017 08:23:10] Zero148: We could also have a character-money system
[30.04.2017 08:23:15] Zero148: not balance but
[30.04.2017 08:23:18] Zero148: Like
[30.04.2017 08:23:25] Zero148: when new people join
[30.04.2017 08:23:42] Zero148: they get a selection of characters they can be
[30.04.2017 08:23:50] Zero148: For example
[30.04.2017 08:24:23] Zero148: Winter Soldier
[30.04.2017 08:24:27] Zero148: Abomination
[30.04.2017 08:24:35] Zero148: Arsenal
[30.04.2017 08:24:45] Zero148: Aqualad
[30.04.2017 08:24:52] Zero148: and Ash
[30.04.2017 08:25:01] Zero148: And by killing mobs
[30.04.2017 08:25:07] Zero148: and/or dueling players
[30.04.2017 08:25:11] Zero148: They get more money
[30.04.2017 08:25:14] _Vigilance_: Damn, I'm so close to a lvl 40 alangasaurus but I dont have enough food :(
[30.04.2017 08:25:23] Zero148: and by the money, they can buy new characters
[30.04.2017 08:25:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: Zero148 is just full of ideas :P
[30.04.2017 08:25:29] Zero148: True
[30.04.2017 08:25:34] Zero148: I am an Idea Nerd
[30.04.2017 08:25:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: unfortunately ideas are not hard to come across
[30.04.2017 08:25:42] Zero148: Im more like
[30.04.2017 08:25:47] Zero148: The Strategist
[30.04.2017 08:25:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: whats hard to come across is people who have the motivation to do the work to make it come true
[30.04.2017 08:26:16] Zero148: I am motivated if it matters
[30.04.2017 08:26:22] Zero148: In the potterworld-copy
[30.04.2017 08:26:23] _Vigilance_: We should do the custom powers idea
[30.04.2017 08:26:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: but MC never matters
[30.04.2017 08:26:32] _Vigilance_: That would draw people in
[30.04.2017 08:26:42] Zero148: I was motivated to be a celdritch player
[30.04.2017 08:26:48] Zero148: idk what the name of the game was
[30.04.2017 08:26:56] _Vigilance_: oh yeee, Tek show Zero148 your office
[30.04.2017 08:27:00] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah i could do the custom hero thing, they could even have a custom name
[30.04.2017 08:27:11] Zero148: But then I was flying over 2 hours and still couldnt become lvl 1 broom -_-
[30.04.2017 08:27:14] Zero148: so I gave up
[30.04.2017 08:27:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: i got lvl 6 broom
[30.04.2017 08:27:34] Zero148: this ak is my jetpack
[30.04.2017 08:27:36] Zero148: look
[30.04.2017 08:27:56] _Vigilance_: Tek show Zero148 your office

[30.04.2017 08:28:43] Zero148: Servers beautiness motivates me
[30.04.2017 08:28:49] Guitar_Hero: where are the buttons?
[30.04.2017 08:28:49] _Vigilance_: The office is a great show btw
[30.04.2017 08:28:52] Guitar_Hero: in the lab
[30.04.2017 08:28:55] Zero148: Zoom
[30.04.2017 08:29:00] Zero148: It turned into self-service
[30.04.2017 08:29:04] Zero148: just go in the capsule
[30.04.2017 08:29:06] Guitar_Hero: oh sick!

[30.04.2017 15:39:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: see, thats the problem with that place. they have 4 servers (dc, marve, and 2 other stupid things) and so that makes for 4 owners. any of the owners can ban and if one owner bans, the person is banned from all servers
[30.04.2017 15:39:16] ImUnicornRainbow: I hate the server Justice Craft

[30.04.2017 15:51:15] _Vigilance_: o
[30.04.2017 15:51:18] God_Doesnt_Exist: so that the fanfics can have a laser
[30.04.2017 15:51:22] _Vigilance_: like just a red laser
[30.04.2017 15:51:26] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah
[30.04.2017 15:51:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: maybe just called "Laser"
[30.04.2017 15:51:35] TonyBongos: welp he raged
[30.04.2017 15:51:46] _Vigilance_: or we could make like 6 lasers, same strength, diff colors
[30.04.2017 15:51:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah
[30.04.2017 15:51:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: we could do that

[30.04.2017 15:52:16] Zero148: Most of the beams on this server are the same weapons
[30.04.2017 15:52:18] _Vigilance_: We should make like 2 thins, 1: Powers, 2: chose an item set i.e a couple guns
[30.04.2017 15:52:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: i really think that making the lasers is the only thing that needs to be done by someone else, everything can be done by me
[30.04.2017 15:52:28] Zero148: Just a particle beam going to the target
[30.04.2017 15:52:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: every fanfic will have access to the same powers
[30.04.2017 15:52:41] _Vigilance_: things*
[30.04.2017 15:52:44] Zero148: I think we should make a gun with a different beam and diff particles
[30.04.2017 15:52:46] God_Doesnt_Exist: its up to the user to determine which of those powers they use
[30.04.2017 15:52:47] TonyBongos: Alpha fight me!
[30.04.2017 15:52:47] Zero148: Maybe diff effects
[30.04.2017 15:52:50] _Vigilance_: We should make like 2 things, 1: Powers, 2: chose an item set i.e a couple guns

[30.04.2017 15:53:11] Zero148: Like, supermans kryp laser beam would give mobs 6dmg and set them on fire
[30.04.2017 15:53:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay go ahead and make those things and let me know when they are done
[30.04.2017 15:53:31] Zero148: Who is making what
[30.04.2017 15:53:51] TonyBongos: Unicorn
[30.04.2017 15:53:53] _Vigilance_: So when you're making it up you take 2 DNA bottles into the machine, one for powers and one for weapons
[30.04.2017 15:53:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: i will be making fanfic stuff once someone makes the lasers for the fanfics
[30.04.2017 15:54:00] SpyJay_YT: :P
[30.04.2017 15:54:01] TonyBongos: Unicorn wants to fight

[30.04.2017 18:42:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: in my opinion, theres just too much wrong with God to make logical sense
[30.04.2017 18:42:49] lbh04: like what?
[30.04.2017 18:42:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: well, God gave us free will right?
[30.04.2017 18:43:04] lbh04: yeah
[30.04.2017 18:43:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: and if we use free will wrong he punishes us right?
[30.04.2017 18:43:18] lbh04: yeah
[30.04.2017 18:43:40] God_Doesnt_Exist: so he's a big allpowerful being that said "here's two choices, you can either use free will or you can believe in me. If you do it wrong, i'm sending you to hell forever"
[30.04.2017 18:43:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats a huge dick move
[30.04.2017 18:43:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: i dont want to worship a dick god like that

[30.04.2017 18:45:07] GoldenAlpha_: hi
[30.04.2017 18:45:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: exactly, so if i use my free will "wrong" he punishes me, i think thats bullshit
[30.04.2017 18:45:08] lbh04: I know
[30.04.2017 18:45:10] lbh04: ??
[30.04.2017 18:45:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: why does he even give us free will if we aren't allowed to use it how we want?
[30.04.2017 18:45:39] lbh04: I just heard some thing say "Hello Baby"
[30.04.2017 18:45:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats server sounds

[30.04.2017 18:46:16] lbh04: The devil gave us free will
[30.04.2017 18:46:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: so you're saying god didn't give us free will? make up ur mind :P
[30.04.2017 18:46:30] Camulll: . hello
[30.04.2017 18:46:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: But god made humans before lucifer existed, so how does that work :P
[30.04.2017 18:46:50] lbh04: No he was an angel before
[30.04.2017 18:47:02] lbh04: and he wanted to be like god
[30.04.2017 18:47:11] lbh04: so God punished him'
[30.04.2017 18:47:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: But god allowed the free will right? he allowed the devil to control us? cuz god could have stopped it if he wanted right?
[30.04.2017 18:47:20] MrGold4: really?

[30.04.2017 18:47:32] lbh04: yeah
[30.04.2017 18:47:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: so god literally allowed the devil to give us free will in hopes that we get to go to hell. thats a shitty move on gods part since he couldd have stopped it
[30.04.2017 18:47:49] lbh04: But then he gave us his one and only son.
[30.04.2017 18:48:13] lbh04: its hard to explane'

[01.05.2017 13:25:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: its not sad
[01.05.2017 13:26:07] _Vigilance_: She just woke up early doh
[01.05.2017 13:26:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: sad is when they are locked up all day chained to a fence and never get to run around and get tired
[01.05.2017 13:26:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: happy is when a dog can relax and just enjoy a day
[01.05.2017 13:26:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: even if they are just sleepy
[01.05.2017 13:26:50] _Vigilance_: Also, can you do option 2 and give fanfics /run 6, and check out the lime laser
[01.05.2017 13:27:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: sure just make sure that shit's in my todo box for later today
[01.05.2017 13:27:52] _Vigilance_: I cant play later today :(
[01.05.2017 13:28:00] _Vigilance_: Well maybe, but probably not
[01.05.2017 13:28:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: why not?
[01.05.2017 13:28:13] _Vigilance_: Actually I'm going to be gone all week
[01.05.2017 13:28:33] _Vigilance_: Well I might be able to play a bit on Wednesday & the weekend
[01.05.2017 13:28:57] _Vigilance_: bc my mom & step-dad are going somewhere and my dad has 0 internet
[01.05.2017 13:29:08] _Vigilance_: And because I dont play on Tuesdays
[01.05.2017 13:29:20] God_Doesnt_Exist: is ur dad a caveman?
[01.05.2017 13:29:25] _Vigilance_: kinda
[01.05.2017 13:29:39] _Vigilance_: his language is like slang sometimes lol
[01.05.2017 13:30:31] _Vigilance_: So usually on mondays I go over to my friend's house and get on, but I'm busy today
[01.05.2017 13:30:48] _Vigilance_: And I'm staying with my dad wednesday & thurseday
[01.05.2017 13:30:56] _Vigilance_: It all depends on how much homework I have really
[01.05.2017 13:31:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: alright, well that shit's still gotta get added to my todo box
[01.05.2017 13:31:24] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats the purpose of it
[01.05.2017 13:31:25] _Vigilance_: I can deff. play over the weekend
[01.05.2017 13:31:45] God_Doesnt_Exist: the whole purpose of my todo box is so i don't have to take individual requests
[01.05.2017 13:31:50] _Vigilance_: Well I've put a couple things in the after hours box and they seem to have gotten nothing done even though one is old
[01.05.2017 13:32:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: have you checked out the office procs?
[01.05.2017 13:32:23] _Vigilance_: I asked for harry potter to have /fly back around when he was created on here and nothing's happened
[01.05.2017 13:32:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: TL;DR if the secretaries fuck up your request, you are entitled to their money
[01.05.2017 13:33:21] _Vigilance_: Damn thats small print
[01.05.2017 13:33:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: u should really read the signs lol
[01.05.2017 13:34:36] _Vigilance_: ./proc info didnt really help
[01.05.2017 13:34:46] God_Doesnt_Exist: theres no such thing as /proc info
[01.05.2017 13:34:58] _Vigilance_: ./proc feature didnt really help
[01.05.2017 13:35:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: help with what?
[01.05.2017 13:35:26] _Vigilance_: knowing if anything's happened to the ideas I put in the after hours box
[01.05.2017 13:36:01] _Vigilance_: When I asked myth to check one of them out he asked "which one, you have 2 in here" which means the harry one's been neglected
[01.05.2017 13:36:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: then you should talk to him about that
[01.05.2017 13:36:32] _Vigilance_: Where do I put this book? There's no after hours box down here
[01.05.2017 13:36:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: oh yeah

[01.05.2017 13:40:08] Zero148: what are your abilities?
[01.05.2017 13:40:52] Zero148: Fun thing is
[01.05.2017 13:40:52] _Vigilance_: At the moment we get /run 2 /jump 2 and /fanficlaser <color> (yellow blue or red rn)
[01.05.2017 13:41:02] Zero148: Fun thing is
[01.05.2017 13:41:04] _Vigilance_: But I've requested we get /run 6 which God_Doesnt_Exist ok'd
[01.05.2017 13:41:12] Zero148: run 6?!

[01.05.2017 13:41:29] Zero148: like

[01.05.2017 13:43:44] Zero148: I spent 2 hours on griefing today :D

[01.05.2017 13:44:15] Zero148: Shulker chests
[01.05.2017 13:44:15] _Vigilance_: That's why I just keep my shit in an enderchest
[01.05.2017 13:44:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: if you dont like griefing, why did u spend 2+ hours griefing xD
[01.05.2017 13:44:22] Zero148: Alpha
[01.05.2017 13:44:27] Zero148: Because
[01.05.2017 13:44:32] Zero148: I now learned the way of this server
[01.05.2017 13:44:41] _Vigilance_: that way I can just switch to firestorm and /transmute enderchest and then get access to all my stuff
[01.05.2017 13:44:44] Zero148: Homo Homini Lupus Est
[01.05.2017 13:44:51] Zero148: Thats what Thomas Hobbes said
[01.05.2017 13:45:10] Zero148: "A human is a werewolf to his being"
[01.05.2017 13:45:22] _Vigilance_: Does that mean you'll turn on them?
[01.05.2017 13:45:28] Zero148: That means
[01.05.2017 13:45:34] Zero148: If we dont have a strict leader
[01.05.2017 13:45:41] Zero148: People will go cause chaos
[01.05.2017 13:45:46] Zero148: And we dont have rules
[01.05.2017 13:45:49] _Vigilance_: lol God_Doesnt_Exist is a very bad example
[01.05.2017 13:45:50] Zero148: So griefing and stuff
[01.05.2017 13:45:55] Zero148: Will al be chaos
[01.05.2017 13:46:03] Zero148: I WILL CAUSE CHAOS >:D
[01.05.2017 13:46:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: i'm a bad example of what?
[01.05.2017 13:46:14] _Vigilance_: You're a bad example of following any kind of rules
[01.05.2017 13:46:22] Zero148: Yea but thats the thing
[01.05.2017 13:46:23] _Vigilance_: bc you just do what you want
[01.05.2017 13:46:28] God_Doesnt_Exist: on my server, absolutely
[01.05.2017 13:46:28] Zero148: There are no rules on here
[01.05.2017 13:46:38] Zero148: So people will cause chaos
[01.05.2017 13:46:45] _Vigilance_: There are no rules because God_Doesnt_Exist made it that way xP
[01.05.2017 13:46:45] Zero148: I mean, I got 2 withers spawned at my house
[01.05.2017 13:46:50] Zero148: Unicorn did it :T
[01.05.2017 13:46:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: i'm totally willing to have rules, i just need to find someone responsible who plays a lot to be head of the popo
[01.05.2017 13:47:05] _Vigilance_: #MandyForChief
[01.05.2017 13:47:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: but as far as i can tell, i have exactly zero of those types of people
[01.05.2017 13:47:16] Zero148: Zero is one
[01.05.2017 13:47:19] Zero148: :D
[01.05.2017 13:47:20] God_Doesnt_Exist: zero is new
[01.05.2017 13:47:20] Zero148: but
[01.05.2017 13:47:24] _Vigilance_: rip bby :'(
[01.05.2017 13:47:24] Zero148: I dont want it
[01.05.2017 13:47:35] Zero148: I dont want to take the role of rulemaster
[01.05.2017 13:47:39] _Vigilance_: #MandyWasAGoodWife
[01.05.2017 13:47:41] Zero148: Because I want to cause chaos
[01.05.2017 13:47:46] God_Doesnt_Exist: plus zero is not one of those tolerant people. he got a small structure griefed and damn near rage quit
[01.05.2017 13:47:51] Zero148: CHAOS BUDDY, CHAOS
[01.05.2017 13:47:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: so i dont really trust his judgement
[01.05.2017 13:47:56] Zero148: Yea true
[01.05.2017 13:48:01] Zero148: Like I said
[01.05.2017 13:48:07] Zero148: 2 hours of griefing was kinda fun
[01.05.2017 13:48:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: i dont want him in charge of jailing peple
[01.05.2017 13:48:13] _Vigilance_: Even still, if there are any rules God_Doesnt_Exist still doesnt follow them
[01.05.2017 13:48:13] Zero148: I got griefed today again xD
[01.05.2017 13:48:22] Zero148: Alph
[01.05.2017 13:48:26] Zero148: I got griefed today again
[01.05.2017 13:48:30] Zero148: by 3 people
[01.05.2017 13:48:31] Zero148: at once
[01.05.2017 13:48:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: that's not true, i'm year 4 in potterworld!
[01.05.2017 13:48:45] _Vigilance_: bc you got 30 AC's
[01.05.2017 13:48:52] Zero148: then I turned into /invis and killed them and took my stuff back
[01.05.2017 13:48:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: u mean cuz i've gotten hundreds of AC
[01.05.2017 13:48:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: :D
[01.05.2017 13:49:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: and how did i get that AC?
[01.05.2017 13:49:04] God_Doesnt_Exist: by following the rules :D
[01.05.2017 13:49:06] Zero148: -_-
[01.05.2017 13:49:17] _Vigilance_: I meant on here
[01.05.2017 13:49:18] Zero148: Fanfics are kinda weak
[01.05.2017 13:49:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: fanfics are supposed to be weak
[01.05.2017 13:49:31] _Vigilance_: We have 0 extra hearts and 0 regen :D
[01.05.2017 13:49:33] Zero148: Well
[01.05.2017 13:49:36] Zero148: WElllll
[01.05.2017 13:49:40] Zero148: We could do
[01.05.2017 13:49:45] Zero148: Normal fanfics
[01.05.2017 13:49:48] _Vigilance_: Thats why I'm going to quit here and play RPMC if theirs is better
[01.05.2017 13:49:48] Zero148: and applied fanfics
[01.05.2017 13:49:57] Zero148: Like
[01.05.2017 13:50:01] Zero148: if you apply as a fanfic
[01.05.2017 13:50:07] Zero148: you create your own char and backstory
[01.05.2017 13:50:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: we'll see how good their fanfic system is. if it's better than mine, i'll just remove mine
[01.05.2017 13:50:18] Zero148: and get powers based on it
[01.05.2017 13:50:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: then u guys can go there for fanfics
[01.05.2017 13:50:24] _Vigilance_: God_Doesnt_Exist hates other people being fanfics for some reason
[01.05.2017 13:50:30] Zero148: :T
[01.05.2017 13:50:34] Zero148: I am a fanfic, im anmed
[01.05.2017 13:50:35] Zero148: named
[01.05.2017 13:50:52] Zero148: InfiMeth Walter Whitehunter
[01.05.2017 13:50:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: martian manhunter is not fanfic
[01.05.2017 13:51:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: sry
[01.05.2017 13:51:02] _Vigilance_: Thats a problem though, because if theirs is better and people can be what they want, people are going to flock there
[01.05.2017 13:51:08] Zero148: xD
[01.05.2017 13:51:18] Zero148: Im not martian manhunter
[01.05.2017 13:51:18] God_Doesnt_Exist: i hope they DO flock there honestly
[01.05.2017 13:51:19] Zero148: Im
[01.05.2017 13:51:22] Zero148: InfiMeth Walter Whitehunter
[01.05.2017 13:51:43] Zero148: Now I only need some cash and quartz named "Crystal Meth"
[01.05.2017 13:51:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: because you're going to see a ton of people give themselves max powers on their server, then you will realize every fanfic on their server has the same OP powers cuz everyone wants to be all powerful
[01.05.2017 13:51:56] Zero148: True
[01.05.2017 13:51:59] Zero148: If I could
[01.05.2017 13:52:01] _Vigilance_: no, they said they're not allowing op powers
[01.05.2017 13:52:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: i don't mean OP as in my server
[01.05.2017 13:52:10] Zero148: Id be Mxy for all day
[01.05.2017 13:52:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: i mean OP as in over powere
[01.05.2017 13:52:13] God_Doesnt_Exist: d
[01.05.2017 13:52:33] Zero148: We should actually do an apply system
[01.05.2017 13:52:38] _Vigilance_: isnt that what people do on here though...?
[01.05.2017 13:52:49] Zero148: I mean, not having one is special
[01.05.2017 13:52:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: no because on here people are forced to be different heoes with differetne powers
[01.05.2017 13:52:57] _Vigilance_: They go to people like Manhattan and Black Racer and OPM
[01.05.2017 13:52:59] Zero148: True
[01.05.2017 13:52:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: with fanfics, everyone can make the same hero just a different name
[01.05.2017 13:53:09] Zero148: Manhattan is Free?
[01.05.2017 13:53:17] _Vigilance_: But OMP & Black Racer are very similar
[01.05.2017 13:53:29] Zero148: Is Manhattan free?!?!?!?
[01.05.2017 13:53:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: so? they still have different powers
[01.05.2017 13:53:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: black racer can fly, OPM cant
[01.05.2017 13:53:42] Zero148: OPM has run 9
[01.05.2017 13:53:43] Zero148: xD
[01.05.2017 13:53:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: black racer doesnt get attacked by mobs, OPM does
[01.05.2017 13:53:51] Zero148: Wait
[01.05.2017 13:53:55] Zero148: By the way
[01.05.2017 13:53:59] Zero148: I got griefed today
[01.05.2017 13:54:02] Zero148: by opm and black racer
[01.05.2017 13:54:03] Zero148: xD
[01.05.2017 13:54:03] _Vigilance_: Thats the thing though, everyone wants to be like them, and if they can make themselves an OPM that CAN fly, they will be happy
[01.05.2017 13:54:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: i know, and you will see tons of OPMs flying around if they are given the opportunity
[01.05.2017 13:54:27] Zero148: We should create a fanfic named Evil Saitama
[01.05.2017 13:54:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: just like how EVERYONE was goku on my server until i made the only-1-hero rule, cuz everyone wanted TP
[01.05.2017 13:54:38] _Vigilance_: Thats why no one uses people like batman on here
[01.05.2017 13:54:46] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats cuz batman sux for powers
[01.05.2017 13:54:52] Zero148: True
[01.05.2017 13:54:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: the only reason batman is "cool" is cuz he's "dark" and "smart"
[01.05.2017 13:55:00] Zero148: Batman is only good with gadgets
[01.05.2017 13:55:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: he doesnt have "powers" he has "smarts" and you can't program "smarts"
[01.05.2017 13:55:05] Zero148: No!
[01.05.2017 13:55:08] _Vigilance_: ye, which is why I'll be happy to play on RPMC because I can be who I want but better
[01.05.2017 13:55:11] Zero148: well
[01.05.2017 13:55:13] Zero148: Batman
[01.05.2017 13:55:19] Zero148: Has recorded himself
[01.05.2017 13:55:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: i'm agreeing with u vig :D
[01.05.2017 13:55:30] Zero148: Calling up all the weaknesses of the justice league alliance
[01.05.2017 13:55:35] Zero148: including himself
[01.05.2017 13:55:43] _Vigilance_: Well God_Doesnt_Exist, if you got the vehicle plugin he'd have a batmobile
[01.05.2017 13:55:44] Zero148: apparently, bats weakness is the ones dear to him
[01.05.2017 13:55:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: xD
[01.05.2017 13:55:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: if you paid for it i'd consider it :D
[01.05.2017 13:56:05] Zero148: Plugins cost money?
[01.05.2017 13:56:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: some do
[01.05.2017 13:56:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: i use like 10 or 15 paid plugins
[01.05.2017 13:56:16] _Vigilance_: You were telling me the other day you made $250 playing minecraft, why dont you buy it? :D
[01.05.2017 13:56:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: cuz i dont see a rason, you're the only one requesting it
[01.05.2017 13:56:33] Zero148: We should make AoT characters
[01.05.2017 13:56:41] Zero148: and let Eren turn into a giant
[01.05.2017 13:56:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: never heard of AoT
[01.05.2017 13:56:48] Zero148: Attack On Titan
[01.05.2017 13:56:50] Zero148: :T
[01.05.2017 13:56:58] Zero148: and Devil May Cry characters
[01.05.2017 13:57:02] _Vigilance_: Becuase certain characters have vehicles, like batman & lex luther, and you're always saying you want them to be accurate and have what they have
[01.05.2017 13:57:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: no i said powers
[01.05.2017 13:57:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: not vehicles xD
[01.05.2017 13:57:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: john cena also has a house but i'm not buiding him one xD
[01.05.2017 13:57:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: cuz it's useless
[01.05.2017 13:57:35] Zero148: batman would be more popular if you gave him a batmobile tho
[01.05.2017 13:57:43] _Vigilance_: Why dont you have vehicles on a city server where people actually have vehicles in comics and movies
[01.05.2017 13:57:50] _Vigilance_: CITY server
[01.05.2017 13:58:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: on a city server? u want a 2nd server?
[01.05.2017 13:58:13] _Vigilance_: If you've ever seen New York, it tends to have some cars
[01.05.2017 13:58:17] Zero148: True
[01.05.2017 13:58:23] Zero148: Lets make a second server
[01.05.2017 13:58:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: and if you've ever seen minecraft, it tends to not be realistic :P
[01.05.2017 13:58:43] _Vigilance_: which is why there are plugins to help it be realistic
[01.05.2017 13:58:49] Zero148: *cough* Realistic mod *cough*
[01.05.2017 13:58:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: so go ahead and buy it for me :D
[01.05.2017 13:59:00] _Vigilance_: you're the one making $250 playing minecraft
[01.05.2017 13:59:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: you're the one asking for it :D
[01.05.2017 13:59:18] Zero148: We are actually helping you
[01.05.2017 13:59:21] Zero148: If we did that
[01.05.2017 13:59:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: how are you helping exactly? by giving suggestions?
[01.05.2017 14:00:03] Zero148: server more popular -> more people joining -> chance of donations higher -> more money -> more plugins -> see 1
[01.05.2017 14:00:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: hey Zero148 you should do homework when you get it so u dont get a bad grade. There, i helped u with ur homework! xD
[01.05.2017 14:00:11] _Vigilance_: People would probably join more often because "WOW Car & Helicopters & Bikes & Planes & Subs & Tanks & Broomsticks in MINECRAFT? WOW THATS COOL!"
[01.05.2017 14:00:19] Zero148: You did
[01.05.2017 14:00:21] Zero148: Except
[01.05.2017 14:00:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: LOL "higher chance of donation"
[01.05.2017 14:00:26] Zero148: I dont have homework
[01.05.2017 14:00:39] Zero148: It is true
[01.05.2017 14:00:45] Zero148: Higher chance of donation
[01.05.2017 14:01:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: what's 100% x 0?
[01.05.2017 14:01:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: answer = 0
[01.05.2017 14:01:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: lol
[01.05.2017 14:01:13] Zero148: Zero
[01.05.2017 14:01:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: no one has ever donated once ever, no matter how many paid plugins i have, getting one more isn't going to get me donations
[01.05.2017 14:02:04] _Vigilance_: bc you do this kind of shit to people's ideas
[01.05.2017 14:02:05] Zero148: Whats: 2 Dollar = Injustice perk - Injustice perk gives you injustice characters like injustice supes/bats/etc.
[01.05.2017 14:02:14] Zero148: answer: Higher rate of donation
[01.05.2017 14:02:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: i already code injustice powers
[01.05.2017 14:02:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: for free
[01.05.2017 14:02:30] Zero148: Injustice skins and more gear
[01.05.2017 14:02:43] Zero148: more gear is a must
[01.05.2017 14:02:46] _Vigilance_: (Just saying, batman has a batmobile in injustice)
[01.05.2017 14:02:53] Zero148: True
[01.05.2017 14:02:54] Zero148: xD
[01.05.2017 14:03:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: "buy it for me, i dont want to D:" - you guys xD
[01.05.2017 14:03:26] Zero148: False
[01.05.2017 14:03:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: then buy it for me :D
[01.05.2017 14:03:33] Zero148: There are "Free Plugins"
[01.05.2017 14:03:45] God_Doesnt_Exist: where is the free vehicle plugin?
[01.05.2017 14:03:45] Zero148: and there are codes
[01.05.2017 14:03:51] Zero148: idk
[01.05.2017 14:03:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: exactly xD
[01.05.2017 14:04:03] Zero148: which plugin web should I use?
[01.05.2017 14:04:13] God_Doesnt_Exist: plugin web?
[01.05.2017 14:04:18] God_Doesnt_Exist: idk what that is
[01.05.2017 14:04:20] Zero148: Where you can see plugins
[01.05.2017 14:04:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: spigot is where most plugins are

[02.05.2017 13:15:43] Zero148: Is a free car plugin
[02.05.2017 13:15:50] Zero148: Its the one I showed you yesterday
[02.05.2017 13:15:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah u showed me that yesterday, it hadn't been updated for 1.11
[02.05.2017 13:16:05] Zero148: Even while it isnt updated since 2015
[02.05.2017 13:16:08] Zero148: It works for 1.11
[02.05.2017 13:16:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah
[02.05.2017 13:16:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: i dont use abandoned plugins
[02.05.2017 13:16:18] God_Doesnt_Exist: they cause server crashes
[02.05.2017 13:16:35] Zero148: Cuz I know a gta server where I played on with 1.11 1 sec ago
[02.05.2017 13:16:44] Zero148: and they use Ucars
[02.05.2017 13:16:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: whats the IP
[02.05.2017 13:16:59] Zero148: Lemme check
[02.05.2017 13:17:05] Zero148: You need a minecart as a car
[02.05.2017 13:17:12] Zero148: So you should first kinda collect items
[02.05.2017 13:17:14] Zero148: from chests
[02.05.2017 13:17:18] Zero148: But there are alot of chests
[02.05.2017 13:17:19] Zero148: ALOT
[02.05.2017 13:17:23] Zero148: lemme check
[02.05.2017 13:17:51] Zero148: play.refinedgta.org
[02.05.2017 13:19:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: how do u know it's ucars
[02.05.2017 13:19:15] Zero148: Asked
[02.05.2017 13:19:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: when u do /plugins it says they only have 1 plugin
[02.05.2017 13:19:26] Zero148: Asked in the serv
[02.05.2017 13:19:35] Zero148: I asked which plugin they use for cars
[02.05.2017 13:19:43] Zero148: One said "I think Ucarts"
[02.05.2017 13:19:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: kewl
[02.05.2017 13:19:48] Zero148: Then I said, you mean Ucars?
[02.05.2017 13:19:55] Zero148: Then she/he said "yeah that"
[02.05.2017 13:20:50] Zero148: We should make some fireball spells
[02.05.2017 13:20:56] Zero148: and add Sasuke
[02.05.2017 13:21:12] Zero148: I mean, susanoo would be a giant
[02.05.2017 13:21:21] Zero148: standard weapon a sword and shurikens
[02.05.2017 13:21:32] Zero148: and Fireballjutsu would be, summoning a fireball
[02.05.2017 13:22:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: ucars appears to be privately updated
[02.05.2017 13:22:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: there's multiple forks of it cuz the original dev stopped
[02.05.2017 13:22:26] God_Doesnt_Exist: and none of them appear to be released
[02.05.2017 13:22:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: so that server must be one of the guys who is custom maintaining it
[02.05.2017 13:22:45] Zero148: aha
[02.05.2017 13:22:50] God_Doesnt_Exist: https://github.com/storm345dev/ucars/tree/1.9 https://github.com/HexagonMC/ucars
[02.05.2017 13:22:53] Zero148: We could do that too
[02.05.2017 13:23:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: theres more than 1 ucars build place
[02.05.2017 13:24:05] Zero148: Soo
[02.05.2017 13:24:08] Zero148: Is that good or not
[02.05.2017 13:24:20] God_Doesnt_Exist: it would be if it was public D:
[02.05.2017 13:24:45] Zero148: I Could ask one of the mods on that gta server for the plugin
[02.05.2017 13:24:50] Zero148: like, beg them for it :T
[02.05.2017 13:25:04] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah but the prob is we'd have to beg every time if there's bugs
[02.05.2017 13:25:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: "please fix ____"
[02.05.2017 13:25:31] Zero148: Or do that ourselves
[02.05.2017 13:25:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: you can code java? then go for it!
[02.05.2017 13:25:51] Zero148: I cant :/
[02.05.2017 13:25:52] Zero148: But
[02.05.2017 13:25:57] Zero148: I am learning about coding
[02.05.2017 13:25:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: then who is "we"
[02.05.2017 13:26:03] Zero148: The server

[02.05.2017 13:26:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: the server can't code anything, sadly
[02.05.2017 13:26:20] God_Doesnt_Exist: and no one on the server i know of can code java except me
[02.05.2017 13:26:34] Zero148: How do you code java exactly
[02.05.2017 13:26:40] God_Doesnt_Exist: using a computer
[02.05.2017 13:27:01] Zero148: Is it like /move minecraftplayer:Zero148 2 2 4
[02.05.2017 13:27:03] Zero148: or something
[02.05.2017 13:27:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: just click on any of these files to see java code https://github.com/HexagonMC/ucars/tree/master/src/main/java/com/useful/ucars

[02.05.2017 13:36:22] Zero148: The funny thing was
[02.05.2017 13:36:29] Zero148: The map in that world
[02.05.2017 13:36:36] Zero148: Is the same map from the GTA server xD
[02.05.2017 13:36:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: that sounds hilarious
[02.05.2017 13:36:59] Zero148: Lemme guess, you typed that before I told you what was funny -_-

[02.05.2017 13:37:49] Zero148: Dont you need your faction to claim the land?
[02.05.2017 13:38:01] Zero148: Since I aint a faction leader or officer I cant claim land right :T
[02.05.2017 13:38:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: make ur own faction
[02.05.2017 13:38:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: prob solved
[02.05.2017 13:38:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: factions beginner tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIcYYTeHJc8
[02.05.2017 13:38:47] Zero148: Nah
[02.05.2017 13:38:53] Zero148: Ill try to be officer in my fac
[02.05.2017 13:39:31] Zero148: Faction land can be seperated?
[02.05.2017 13:39:56] Zero148: Like, one bit of claimed land at x_ y_ and the other bit at x_ y_
[02.05.2017 13:40:13] Zero148: or does it have to stick to eachother
[02.05.2017 13:40:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think it's gotta stick, but i've honestly never made a faction so i could be wrong, but i think all territory must be attached to existing territory
[02.05.2017 13:40:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: no fragmenting
[02.05.2017 13:40:59] Zero148: Aha
[02.05.2017 13:41:10] Zero148: Also, could you send the java link again
[02.05.2017 13:41:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: just click on any of these files to see java code https://github.com/HexagonMC/ucars/tree/master/src/main/java/com/useful/ucars

[02.05.2017 13:45:15] Zero148: Not java
[02.05.2017 13:45:26] God_Doesnt_Exist: no you've never coded before because what you said makes no sense
[02.05.2017 13:45:34] Zero148: java.Array
[02.05.2017 13:45:38] Zero148: never heard of that before
[02.05.2017 13:46:20] Zero148: Is coding the basic thing for starting a server?
[02.05.2017 13:46:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: to start a server you don't need to know any code
[02.05.2017 13:46:41] Zero148: To grow your server bigger
[02.05.2017 13:46:51] Zero148: Isnt there a tool to help you with coding
[02.05.2017 13:46:55] Zero148: like, coding with blocks

[02.05.2017 13:48:43] Zero148: Like, scratch-ish

[02.05.2017 14:24:26] Zero148: Saitama never get to feel harm
[02.05.2017 14:24:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: i've never seen saitama do a parody punch, so ur argument is invalid

[02.05.2017 14:24:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: he still didnt do a parody punch
[02.05.2017 14:24:59] Zero148: There was also someone
[02.05.2017 14:25:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: manhattan can just go intangible, then he can't even BE punched. then be blinks and saitama disappears
[02.05.2017 14:25:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: rip saitama
[02.05.2017 14:25:14] Zero148: Who tried to erase Saitama by his monecules
[02.05.2017 14:25:16] BlueWolf4Life: Why Dont I have intangible?
[02.05.2017 14:25:26] God_Doesnt_Exist: no one tried to erase him by his molecules
[02.05.2017 14:25:29] Zero148: and Saitama just stood there vibrating a little bit and laughing
[02.05.2017 14:25:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: that i know of

[02.05.2017 14:25:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: you'd have to show me
[02.05.2017 14:25:51] Zero148: Saitama said
[02.05.2017 14:25:56] Zero148: "It feels funny"
[02.05.2017 14:26:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: even so, vibrating molecules and making them disappear altogether are two different things
[02.05.2017 14:26:03] Zero148: Funny thing is that he wasnt even serious then
[02.05.2017 14:26:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: he's never serious
[02.05.2017 14:26:20] Zero148: Well
[02.05.2017 14:26:24] Zero148: Like I said
[02.05.2017 14:26:34] Zero148: There is one punch so serious that can restart the universe
[02.05.2017 14:26:39] Zero148: which means he can be serious
[02.05.2017 14:26:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: and like i said even so, vibrating molecules and making them disappear altogether are two different things. manhattan wins cuz he can't even BE punched
[02.05.2017 14:26:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: if he chooses
[02.05.2017 14:26:58] BlueWolf4Life: Why Dont I have intangible?

[02.05.2017 14:28:55] Zero148: All Feats
[02.05.2017 14:28:59] BlueWolf4Life: I can just make him say his name backwards

[02.05.2017 14:30:45] Zero148: Just to show some fun to the king of the 5th dimension
[02.05.2017 14:31:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: mxy got his ass KICKED by superman prime, who wasn't even like a god or anything
[02.05.2017 14:31:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: he was begging for his life

[02.05.2017 23:26:30] LostInGalaxeh_: Only speedsters are permitted to go in the speedforce.
[02.05.2017 23:26:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: and use the standard force things i made
[02.05.2017 23:26:38] LostInGalaxeh_: To go in the speedforce, do /warp speedforce
[02.05.2017 23:26:42] adambash: ok
[02.05.2017 23:26:44] adambash: Harkie Parkie
[02.05.2017 23:26:46] mythguy1226: ok :(
[02.05.2017 23:26:47] LostInGalaxeh_: You can go to the lab through the speedforce
[02.05.2017 23:26:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: its just too confusing to have mixed powers in the wands
[02.05.2017 23:27:05] LostInGalaxeh_: You can 1-punch people once you bring them into the speedforce
[02.05.2017 23:27:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: it only makes sense with magic uses who use wands like harry potter, dumle, zatana
[02.05.2017 23:27:14] Camulll: ZATANNA
[02.05.2017 23:27:16] Camulll: NOT ZATANA
[02.05.2017 23:27:23] ImUnicornRainbow: see my high score adam :DD

[02.05.2017 23:27:35] ImUnicornRainbow: xDD and yet no1 has beaten it
[02.05.2017 23:27:39] adambash: yeah
[02.05.2017 23:27:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: cuz yoda doesnt need to hold a stick/wand to use the force
[02.05.2017 23:27:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: he should be able to do it empty handed
[02.05.2017 23:27:59] De_Archer: think of the stick/wand as his cane
[02.05.2017 23:27:59] LostInGalaxeh_: brb getting food
[02.05.2017 23:28:00] adambash: he does it al the time

[02.05.2017 23:29:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: is force grip the same as force choke
[02.05.2017 23:29:24] LeoMCU: hes good at being a dick :)

[04.05.2017 01:53:55] mythguy1226: should I make 2 seperate characters for Jean grey and pheonix? or 1 character
[04.05.2017 01:54:12] ImUnicornRainbow: You should make a command that gives her the pheonix powers
[04.05.2017 01:54:19] ImUnicornRainbow: lile /buff 2 or summ
[04.05.2017 01:54:47] mythguy1226: maybe.. cuz pheonix is pretty much jean grey's full power
[04.05.2017 01:55:37] mythguy1226: maybe I'll make 2 sep chars
[04.05.2017 01:55:55] mythguy1226: that way if pheonix is an op I don't have to make jean grey op as well
[04.05.2017 01:56:25] ImUnicornRainbow: She is OP
[04.05.2017 01:56:32] ImUnicornRainbow: she can destroy the universe if she wants
[04.05.2017 01:56:45] mythguy1226: yeah but that is when she turns into pheonix

[04.05.2017 01:56:54] ImUnicornRainbow: Still*
[04.05.2017 01:57:06] mythguy1226: but the normal jean grey holds back so she doesnt do that
[04.05.2017 01:57:07] ImUnicornRainbow: Pheonix comes ut of her when she is either angry or afraid right?
[04.05.2017 01:57:17] ImUnicornRainbow: Holding back doesnt mean she cant do it
[04.05.2017 01:57:26] ImUnicornRainbow: WW holds back on her strength, she still has it
[04.05.2017 01:58:05] mythguy1226: ye but still jean grye shouldn't be op if her normal self isn't op
[04.05.2017 01:58:08] ImUnicornRainbow: Plus, she didnt hold back in X men apocalypse xD

[04.05.2017 01:59:28] ImUnicornRainbow: Jean is what is known to be an Omega Level Mutant
[04.05.2017 01:59:29] mythguy1226: maybe I'll just make pheonix and if someone wants the normal version... I'll just make a new char for that
[04.05.2017 02:00:04] ImUnicornRainbow: Jean is what is known to be an Omega Level Mutant, telepath, telekenetic, and other abilities that she has
[04.05.2017 02:00:23] mythguy1226: yeah she has the ability but if she doesnt actually use it then gde doesnt allow it
[04.05.2017 02:00:26] ImUnicornRainbow: Omega Level mutants are not like regular mutants, they are more powerful

[04.05.2017 02:01:08] ImUnicornRainbow: Exactly
[04.05.2017 02:01:10] ImUnicornRainbow: She should be OP
[04.05.2017 02:01:22] mythguy1226: so ur saying both chars that I make should be op
[04.05.2017 02:01:27] ImUnicornRainbow: No

[04.05.2017 02:49:17] ImUnicornRainbow: you have to move alittle to the side so that you dont fall off

[04.05.2017 02:51:06] ImUnicornRainbow: another thing that I do is I look down while jumping off of that block
[04.05.2017 02:51:07] mythguy1226: you'll get it gde it just takes practice :)
[04.05.2017 02:51:16] _Vigilance_: .
[04.05.2017 02:51:24] ImUnicornRainbow: You need to use positions that make your hand comfortable

[04.05.2017 02:55:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: so like
[04.05.2017 02:55:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: if someone says "can you make fuckingstupidchar" the secretary explains they can make it themselves

[04.05.2017 02:58:29] mythguy1226: maybe I could just do that for heroes I don't know about
[04.05.2017 02:58:30] xSp4rkz: I can do that for requests then if people want to send them to me
[04.05.2017 02:58:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: its up to the person requesting the hero to provide the proof
[04.05.2017 02:58:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: it is not our job to provide and search for proof
[04.05.2017 02:58:43] xSp4rkz: Good
[04.05.2017 02:58:46] God_Doesnt_Exist: its the responsibility of the requester

[04.05.2017 14:26:40] Glint73: batman
[04.05.2017 14:26:42] EmmettGaming: BATMAN
[04.05.2017 14:26:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: batman wins at chess
[04.05.2017 14:26:50] EmmettGaming: APLHA
[04.05.2017 14:26:56] EmmettGaming: have u seen batman vs superman
[04.05.2017 14:27:04] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah batman lost
[04.05.2017 14:27:05] Glint73: b
[04.05.2017 14:27:08] EmmettGaming: no he won
[04.05.2017 14:27:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: he lost
[04.05.2017 14:27:16] Glint73: no 1 won
[04.05.2017 14:27:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: he lost
[04.05.2017 14:27:31] EmmettGaming: in the comics they both died
[04.05.2017 14:27:38] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats a lie
[04.05.2017 14:27:40] God_Doesnt_Exist: again
[04.05.2017 14:27:52] EmmettGaming: he kills superman
[04.05.2017 14:27:53] Glint73: alpha no 1 won :PPP
[04.05.2017 14:27:58] EmmettGaming: then has heart attack in comics
[04.05.2017 14:27:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: the only one to ever kill superman was doomsday
[04.05.2017 14:28:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: and even then apparently superman wasnt dead
[04.05.2017 14:28:09] Glint73: and me
[04.05.2017 14:28:12] Glint73: :P
[04.05.2017 14:28:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: in superman v batman, superman says "i'm not going to fight you. if i wanted you dead, you'd be dead already"
[04.05.2017 14:28:32] EmmettGaming: he turned into electric superman
[04.05.2017 14:28:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: so superman basically just let batman win cuz superman is a good guy
[04.05.2017 14:28:46] God_Doesnt_Exist: if it was really superman v batman, superman stomps
[04.05.2017 14:28:55] EmmettGaming: in the comics
[04.05.2017 14:28:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: in the comics neither died
[04.05.2017 14:29:04] EmmettGaming: batman dies by heart attack when he knocked out superman
[04.05.2017 14:29:18] Glint73: if it was grilledcheese v a taco grilledcheese would win :P
[04.05.2017 14:29:18] EmmettGaming: so superman won
[04.05.2017 14:30:00] EmmettGaming: batman and deadpool
[04.05.2017 14:30:07] Glint73: deadpool
[04.05.2017 14:30:10] EmmettGaming: have had op powers in the past
[04.05.2017 14:30:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: batman
[04.05.2017 14:30:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: depends on which verison of deadpool tho
[04.05.2017 14:30:30] EmmettGaming: deadpool like normal deadpool
[04.05.2017 14:30:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: batman wins
[04.05.2017 14:30:38] EmmettGaming: why
[04.05.2017 14:30:43] Glint73: theres diffrent deadpool like diffrent spidermen?
[04.05.2017 14:30:56] EmmettGaming: Deadpool never died
[04.05.2017 14:30:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes one versio of deadpool crawled off the comic book page and killed stan lee
[04.05.2017 14:31:00] God_Doesnt_Exist: and thanos
[04.05.2017 14:31:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: and every other character
[04.05.2017 14:31:05] EmmettGaming: befor
[04.05.2017 14:31:19] Glint73: omg
[04.05.2017 14:31:30] EmmettGaming: Batman
[04.05.2017 14:31:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: batman is just too good with prep. deadpool would have no idea batman is there. all deadpool has is regen
[04.05.2017 14:31:38] Glint73: rlly lowers my opion with deadepool
[04.05.2017 14:31:49] EmmettGaming: batman
[04.05.2017 14:31:58] EmmettGaming: has beaten gods
[04.05.2017 14:32:07] Glint73: alpha
[04.05.2017 14:32:14] EmmettGaming: and has knocked out superman loads of times
[04.05.2017 14:32:14] Glint73: some1 needs to make stanlee
[04.05.2017 14:32:21] EmmettGaming: stanlee would be a OP
[04.05.2017 14:32:28] Glint73: yeah
[04.05.2017 14:32:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: if batman and superman actually wanted to kill each other, theres just no way batman can win. the problem is that superman would never kill batman
[04.05.2017 14:32:54] Glint73: do you know whats wierd
[04.05.2017 14:32:59] EmmettGaming: Yeah
[04.05.2017 14:33:05] Glint73: besides me
[04.05.2017 14:33:07] EmmettGaming: robin saving superman in the comics
[04.05.2017 14:33:13] God_Doesnt_Exist: lets say superman was blood lusted and actually wanted to kill batman. superman could just throw earth into the sun. RIP batman
[04.05.2017 14:33:33] EmmettGaming: he would not do that
[04.05.2017 14:33:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: i know he woudln't
[04.05.2017 14:33:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats why i said "lets say"
[04.05.2017 14:33:42] EmmettGaming: he would just punch superman
[04.05.2017 14:33:45] Glint73: but "IF"
[04.05.2017 14:33:51] EmmettGaming: *batman
[04.05.2017 14:33:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: lol wtf is a human going to do punching superman xDD
[04.05.2017 14:34:00] EmmettGaming: and batman would be dead
[04.05.2017 14:34:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: punching doesnt do shit
[04.05.2017 14:34:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: xD
[04.05.2017 14:34:13] EmmettGaming: i said superman would punch batman
[04.05.2017 14:34:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: o
[04.05.2017 14:34:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: batman ye
[04.05.2017 14:34:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: i dont think so
[04.05.2017 14:34:24] Glint73: i wish there was a way to turn of swears in chat
[04.05.2017 14:34:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think thats too risky for superman
[04.05.2017 14:34:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: if superman ACTUALLY wanted to kill batman, he wouldn't punch batman, cuz he knows batman probs has kryptonite near him. so then batman just uses his superbreath to blow earth into the sun
[04.05.2017 14:34:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: without getting close to batman
[04.05.2017 14:35:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: why dont u like swears
[04.05.2017 14:35:23] Glint73: im a kid
[04.05.2017 14:35:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: this is an adult server
[04.05.2017 14:35:38] Glint73: :P
[04.05.2017 14:35:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: if you can't handle the swears, i suggest finding a different server
[04.05.2017 14:36:35] Glint73: idk what to do :P
[04.05.2017 14:36:45] God_Doesnt_Exist: you can say /ch switch local
[04.05.2017 14:36:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: to turn off chat for u
[04.05.2017 14:36:53] Glint73: ty

[04.05.2017 14:37:04] xSp4rkz: Good kid
[04.05.2017 14:38:56] EmmettGaming: GDE superman would freeze batman
[04.05.2017 14:39:12] EmmettGaming: and then grab him
[04.05.2017 14:39:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: no emmett i think batman could prevent that using a heated suit
[04.05.2017 14:39:21] EmmettGaming: fly into the sun
[04.05.2017 14:39:46] EmmettGaming: superman would melt him
[04.05.2017 14:40:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: batman can use an unmeltable alloy
[04.05.2017 14:40:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: the only way to safely beat batman is to do a long distance attack
[04.05.2017 14:40:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: that is unblockable
[04.05.2017 14:40:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: such as throwing the entire planet into a star
[04.05.2017 14:40:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: imo

[04.05.2017 15:37:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: you said you would "DO ANYTHING" to use heroes again and to prove you're sorry. so all you gotta do is play spleef against your sister.

[04.05.2017 15:43:05] xSp4rkz: sir
[04.05.2017 15:43:18] God_Doesnt_Exist: hello
[04.05.2017 15:43:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: im testing an annoyance feature
[04.05.2017 15:43:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: so i can annoy players
[04.05.2017 15:43:30] xSp4rkz: hahaha
[04.05.2017 15:45:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats so weird...
[04.05.2017 15:45:17] xSp4rkz: what does it do
[04.05.2017 15:45:50] God_Doesnt_Exist: TPs you to another player in an infiite loop at a $var amount of delay between TP
[04.05.2017 15:45:55] xSp4rkz: lmao
[04.05.2017 15:46:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: 1 tick TPs are fun
[04.05.2017 15:47:40] xSp4rkz: Thats awesome lol
[04.05.2017 15:48:20] God_Doesnt_Exist: the command works perfectly, zero problems, except that every time i run it, it says "Unknown command"
[04.05.2017 15:48:27] xSp4rkz: Weird
[04.05.2017 15:48:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: but the command runs

[04.05.2017 15:48:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: thers no error
[04.05.2017 15:49:12] xSp4rkz: ok
[04.05.2017 15:49:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: during that loop if i choose to annoy another player, it cancels the loops on you and begins it on them
[04.05.2017 15:49:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: only when switching players like that does the error occur
[04.05.2017 15:49:33] xSp4rkz: Can I see the code?
[04.05.2017 15:49:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: it does not occur during 1st run
[04.05.2017 15:49:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: sure
[04.05.2017 15:50:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: oh what the fuck

[04.05.2017 16:10:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay
[04.05.2017 16:11:50] xSp4rkz: Is your error because of continue() instead of break() ?
[04.05.2017 16:12:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: i could try break, bu i think that throws an error cuz we aren't in a loop
[04.05.2017 16:12:35] EmmettGaming: GDE
[04.05.2017 16:12:39] xSp4rkz: Ahhh
[04.05.2017 16:12:43] xSp4rkz: Okay lemme check again

[04.05.2017 16:15:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: which i haven't tested
[04.05.2017 16:15:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: when i was testing, i would get the error when switching between you and emmett
[04.05.2017 16:15:36] xSp4rkz: Interesting
[04.05.2017 16:15:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: but you guys are in differetn worlds. if the error doesnt happen if you're in the same world, that narrows it down
[04.05.2017 16:15:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: i havent' tested that aspect yet
[04.05.2017 16:15:56] xSp4rkz: That would make sense
[04.05.2017 16:18:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: yup
[04.05.2017 16:18:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: in the same world no error
