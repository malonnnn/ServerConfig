[07.05.2017 02:29:10] xDcGamer_MCU: kept asking me
[07.05.2017 02:29:17] xDcGamer_MCU: so i asked ImUnicornRainbow she said she was busy

[07.05.2017 02:29:46] xDcGamer_MCU: ,and I'm wondering if you could give me access to giving interviews
[07.05.2017 02:29:53] xDcGamer_MCU: or just allow me to prove myself
[07.05.2017 02:30:13] xSp4rkz: Okay thanks for letting me know. Right now im just going to have the Sergeants do the interviews
[07.05.2017 02:30:18] xSp4rkz: But I'll keep you in mind

[07.05.2017 02:30:36] xSp4rkz: Im not in a mad rush for officers so its okay if people arent interviewed immediately
[07.05.2017 02:30:41] xSp4rkz: I'll slow down hiring soon
[07.05.2017 02:30:47] xDcGamer_MCU: Oh ok sounds good.
[07.05.2017 02:30:56] xSp4rkz: Oh and I'm setting up lockers for each officer where I'll be able to communicate with you
[07.05.2017 02:30:59] xSp4rkz: And pay you
[07.05.2017 02:31:04] xDcGamer_MCU: oh thanks bro :D
[07.05.2017 02:31:13] xDcGamer_MCU: Thanks man really appreciate it
[07.05.2017 02:31:24] xSp4rkz: np. I think $1,000 a day is fair

[07.05.2017 02:31:33] xDcGamer_MCU: with that

[07.05.2017 02:31:43] xDcGamer_MCU: lol
[07.05.2017 02:37:10] xSp4rkz: Pressing this button gives us privacy
[07.05.2017 02:37:30] HerpaDerp10000: great
[07.05.2017 02:37:46] xSp4rkz: This area is 100 blocks away from the station so nobody can listen in
[07.05.2017 02:37:58] HerpaDerp10000: FINALLY YES xD
[07.05.2017 02:38:15] xSp4rkz: Thats why I made the doors gold plates so only sergeants can open it
[07.05.2017 02:38:26] HerpaDerp10000: cool
[07.05.2017 02:38:28] xSp4rkz: We can bring Officers here, but I dont want them coming and going just to listen
[07.05.2017 02:38:44] HerpaDerp10000: yes emmett does that all the time
[07.05.2017 02:39:00] xSp4rkz: So yeah thats about it. Im going to add one more thing at the front. And then I'll have more time to help out

[07.05.2017 02:40:22] xSp4rkz: Let me know if you do so I can remove his other permissions
[07.05.2017 02:40:23] HerpaDerp10000: thankyou sir as u can see ive been giving him leeway since he is new
[07.05.2017 02:40:36] xSp4rkz: If you do /fireofficer it will remove their access to the front door
[07.05.2017 02:40:40] xSp4rkz: And their powers
[07.05.2017 02:40:48] HerpaDerp10000: oh okay sir thakyou

[07.05.2017 02:42:20] xSp4rkz: I just told him to switch local
[07.05.2017 02:42:22] ImUnicornRainbow: Oh.
[07.05.2017 02:42:24] xSp4rkz: There
[07.05.2017 02:42:24] God_Doesnt_Exist: i fixed it
[07.05.2017 02:42:29] xSp4rkz: Your the man
[07.05.2017 02:42:40] God_Doesnt_Exist: your officers have the powers but you must /hireofficer and /hiresergeant
[07.05.2017 02:42:42] xSp4rkz: I made this area 100 blocks away for privacy
[07.05.2017 02:42:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: on your staff
[07.05.2017 02:42:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: it will apply their permissions
[07.05.2017 02:42:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: o wait
[07.05.2017 02:42:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think i can do it automatically
[07.05.2017 02:42:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: one sec
[07.05.2017 02:43:03] xSp4rkz: np
[07.05.2017 02:43:06] ImUnicornRainbow: So, Sp4rk.
[07.05.2017 02:43:12] xSp4rkz: Whats up ImUnicornRainbow
[07.05.2017 02:43:13] ImUnicornRainbow: I think that we should have a limited number of Officers...
[07.05.2017 02:43:17] ImUnicornRainbow: Too many people are applying.
[07.05.2017 02:43:27] xSp4rkz: I agree. I dont want everyone joining
[07.05.2017 02:43:32] xSp4rkz: Only qualified people
[07.05.2017 02:43:33] ImUnicornRainbow: I also think that there should be a time rate where people should be able to join.
[07.05.2017 02:43:42] ImUnicornRainbow: Like be on the server for 2 months atleast.
[07.05.2017 02:43:42] xSp4rkz: Agreed
[07.05.2017 02:43:46] ImUnicornRainbow: Or more.
[07.05.2017 02:43:49] xSp4rkz: 100$
[07.05.2017 02:43:52] xSp4rkz: 100%
[07.05.2017 02:44:08] ImUnicornRainbow: We need to make sure people know what they are doing before they apply, that will help.
[07.05.2017 02:44:17] ImUnicornRainbow: it saves us time and it lets us do our job.
[07.05.2017 02:44:20] xSp4rkz: Yeah absolutely.
[07.05.2017 02:44:27] ImUnicornRainbow: :D thanks
[07.05.2017 02:44:29] xSp4rkz: I want people who have been here for a while
[07.05.2017 02:44:32] ImUnicornRainbow: You're the man.
[07.05.2017 02:44:36] xSp4rkz: Thats why I have a second interview
[07.05.2017 02:44:45] xSp4rkz: I check their username too to see how often they come
[07.05.2017 02:45:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay sparkz
[07.05.2017 02:45:04] ImUnicornRainbow: Thats smart.
[07.05.2017 02:45:04] xSp4rkz: We can freeze hiring for a bit
[07.05.2017 02:45:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: everyone has it
[07.05.2017 02:45:10] xSp4rkz: Excellent
[07.05.2017 02:45:11] ImUnicornRainbow: Yeah, that would be great.
[07.05.2017 02:45:13] God_Doesnt_Exist: so all ur officers and sergeants can do
[07.05.2017 02:45:18] ImUnicornRainbow: can do what/
[07.05.2017 02:45:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: ./addchatcooldown <plr> and /remchatcooldown <plr>
[07.05.2017 02:45:34] ImUnicornRainbow: Oh, thanks.
[07.05.2017 02:45:38] xSp4rkz: Perfect
[07.05.2017 02:45:42] xSp4rkz: Thanks bro
[07.05.2017 02:45:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: np
[07.05.2017 02:45:51] xSp4rkz: I'll add it to the books
[07.05.2017 02:46:02] ImUnicornRainbow: so, now that we are here....
[07.05.2017 02:46:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: i want the police force to work and it will take some coding to get the idiots to ebey
[07.05.2017 02:46:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: obey*
[07.05.2017 02:46:10] ImUnicornRainbow: GDE
[07.05.2017 02:46:18] xSp4rkz: hahaha itll work. We have to iron out the details lol
[07.05.2017 02:46:22] ImUnicornRainbow: We should add a rule that makes people not able to kill Officers when we are on duty lol
[07.05.2017 02:46:30] ImUnicornRainbow: because too many people attack us when we are on duty
[07.05.2017 02:46:35] xSp4rkz: I can finally spend more time with them now that I'm almost done building
[07.05.2017 02:46:46] xSp4rkz: I can take care of that no problem
[07.05.2017 02:46:58] ImUnicornRainbow: Ty :D
[07.05.2017 02:47:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: sparkz when i ran the police force before, i gave the police only the necessary tools to arrest people. this was to prevent them from hanging out as a police officer all day and force them into a superhero
[07.05.2017 02:47:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: would you like to continue to follow this?
[07.05.2017 02:47:50] God_Doesnt_Exist: for example, ImUnicornRainbow just asked for police invincibility
[07.05.2017 02:47:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: which owuld prompt all officers to never leave officer status
[07.05.2017 02:48:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: and be onduty all the time
[07.05.2017 02:48:05] xSp4rkz: Yeah I actually removed it
[07.05.2017 02:48:12] ImUnicornRainbow: No I didnt ask for that.
[07.05.2017 02:48:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: removed what
[07.05.2017 02:48:21] xSp4rkz: kill immunity
[07.05.2017 02:48:24] ImUnicornRainbow: I want people to be warned or introuble when they kill us.
[07.05.2017 02:48:28] ImUnicornRainbow: On Duty..
[07.05.2017 02:48:36] ImUnicornRainbow: We might be looking for proof, and they just kill us..
[07.05.2017 02:48:37] xSp4rkz: And I dont want them on duty all the time
[07.05.2017 02:48:48] xSp4rkz: Is there a way to make an /offduty command?
[07.05.2017 02:48:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: i can add a timer for onduty
[07.05.2017 02:48:57] xSp4rkz: Yeah perfect
[07.05.2017 02:49:20] xSp4rkz: I want them to spend time playing or working in your office if they do or whatever
[07.05.2017 02:49:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes, but i didnt want to give an offduty command because people haeve a tendancy to do /onduty <command> /offduty abuse. by forcing them to use the hero changer, it added a layer of inconvenience
[07.05.2017 02:49:46] God_Doesnt_Exist: however, i will still add it if you wish, just say the word
[07.05.2017 02:49:47] xSp4rkz: Gotcha
[07.05.2017 02:49:51] xSp4rkz: Nope
[07.05.2017 02:49:59] xSp4rkz: Timer is good.
[07.05.2017 02:50:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: i dont think timer is the right soution either honestly
[07.05.2017 02:50:35] xSp4rkz: I can put out a notice
[07.05.2017 02:50:38] xSp4rkz: See if that works
[07.05.2017 02:50:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think the best solution is to allow them indefinite time, just make sure that officer status doesnt have too many perks
[07.05.2017 02:50:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: just tools to arrest criminals, not perks to use as superhero
[07.05.2017 02:50:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: u know?
[07.05.2017 02:51:01] xSp4rkz: Yeah I dont want them to have perks, just to be able to enforce rules.
[07.05.2017 02:51:02] ImUnicornRainbow: GDE...
[07.05.2017 02:51:11] ImUnicornRainbow: You dont have to give us resistance to not get hurt..
[07.05.2017 02:51:18] ImUnicornRainbow: you can just make a rule againts killing us when onduty..
[07.05.2017 02:51:19] ImUnicornRainbow: xD
[07.05.2017 02:51:23] xSp4rkz: I can still give you that in the Office.
[07.05.2017 02:51:23] ImUnicornRainbow: no need for all that work.
[07.05.2017 02:51:41] xSp4rkz: But when playing normally the only powers you guys have is to enforce rules
[07.05.2017 02:51:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: how about
[07.05.2017 02:52:08] xSp4rkz: I have an idea
[07.05.2017 02:52:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: cops get a totem so if they die, they dont really die but theres still the inconveniece of damage
[07.05.2017 02:52:50] xSp4rkz: Can you allow them indefinite time to be on duty when in the policeoffice world, but a 2 minute timer anywhere else?
[07.05.2017 02:52:53] xSp4rkz: Or is that hard
[07.05.2017 02:53:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: no thats ezpz
[07.05.2017 02:53:12] xSp4rkz: Then it would encourage hero usage
[07.05.2017 02:53:18] God_Doesnt_Exist: copy that big daddy
[07.05.2017 02:53:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: coding up right now
[07.05.2017 02:53:25] xSp4rkz: Excellent
[07.05.2017 02:56:28] ImUnicornRainbow: ..
[07.05.2017 02:56:30] ImUnicornRainbow: soo..
[07.05.2017 02:56:31] ImUnicornRainbow: um..

[07.05.2017 02:58:55] HerpaDerp10000: lol
[07.05.2017 03:19:48] xSp4rkz: Hey God_Doesnt_Exist
[07.05.2017 03:19:56] xSp4rkz: Sorry I rudely left. My power went out

[07.05.2017 04:01:00] Grim765Reaper: cheif i cant open them
[07.05.2017 04:01:09] Grim765Reaper: cheif i cant open them
[07.05.2017 04:24:11] ImUnicornRainbow: ..
[07.05.2017 04:24:14] ImUnicornRainbow: so um..

[07.05.2017 04:24:23] xSp4rkz: Did Grim765Reaper get fired?
[07.05.2017 04:24:30] ImUnicornRainbow: ? I dont know.

[07.05.2017 04:24:56] ImUnicornRainbow: Okay.
[07.05.2017 04:25:02] xSp4rkz: If you ever fire someone drop a note in my box so I know so I can remove all permissions
[07.05.2017 04:25:08] ImUnicornRainbow: Okie.
[07.05.2017 04:25:16] xSp4rkz: Firing removes a lot of permissions, but I need to remove more
[07.05.2017 04:25:19] xSp4rkz: Thats all :)

[07.05.2017 04:25:47] ImUnicornRainbow: ?
[07.05.2017 04:25:57] ImUnicornRainbow: Where do we collect it?
[07.05.2017 04:25:57] xSp4rkz: Just step on your plate and it pays you

[09.05.2017 22:45:27] xSp4rkz: Well hold off on the hiring until I punish those for this. I want the whole story first
[09.05.2017 22:45:34] ImUnicornRainbow: Okay.

[09.05.2017 23:26:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: its not really a command, its a permission you give someone
[09.05.2017 23:26:08] xSp4rkz: Okay
[09.05.2017 23:26:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: i can make it a command for ur officers if u want
[09.05.2017 23:26:19] xSp4rkz: More for sergeants and me
[09.05.2017 23:26:20] God_Doesnt_Exist: but anyone with the permission arrest.onjoin
[09.05.2017 23:26:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: gets jailed when they log in
[09.05.2017 23:26:38] God_Doesnt_Exist: ./pex user USER add arrest.onjoin

[09.05.2017 23:26:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay
[09.05.2017 23:27:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: i knew you'd cycle through ur staff, its the only way to learn
[09.05.2017 23:27:25] xSp4rkz: Now about the players, should I leave it and have them punished next time in real-time?
[09.05.2017 23:27:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: um
[09.05.2017 23:27:37] xSp4rkz: My staff is gonna be punished regardless
[09.05.2017 23:28:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: i have no qualms about what you do. you're in charge of the police and distributed beatings, so however you want to distribute those beatings is fine by me

[09.05.2017 23:42:30] ImUnicornRainbow: I've seen it happen.
[09.05.2017 23:42:33] ImUnicornRainbow: Yes
[09.05.2017 23:42:34] ImUnicornRainbow: Galaxeh
[09.05.2017 23:42:36] nightghost2: Hark thinks i should instantly jail them
[09.05.2017 23:42:40] ImUnicornRainbow: Yeah.
[09.05.2017 23:42:42] nightghost2: Whenever i warn them
[09.05.2017 23:42:48] xSp4rkz: No. Shes the worst offender
[09.05.2017 23:42:56] xSp4rkz: Shes going to serve a jail sentence
[09.05.2017 23:43:04] xSp4rkz: I've already received the blessing from GDE
[09.05.2017 23:43:07] ImUnicornRainbow: xD
[09.05.2017 23:43:10] ImUnicornRainbow: "blessing"
[09.05.2017 23:43:26] xSp4rkz: Im talking to everyone and giving GDE the respect of notifying him
[09.05.2017 23:43:42] ImUnicornRainbow: hmm
[09.05.2017 23:43:43] xSp4rkz: I already talked to GDE so he's given me his blessing to discipline as I please
[09.05.2017 23:43:44] ImUnicornRainbow: Sp4rk..
[09.05.2017 23:43:51] nightghost2: Seems fair
[09.05.2017 23:43:53] ImUnicornRainbow: I think that we should do something about jail.....
[09.05.2017 23:44:01] xSp4rkz: Okay?
[09.05.2017 23:44:04] xSp4rkz: What about it?
[09.05.2017 23:44:05] ImUnicornRainbow: I think that we should add a timer..... /arrest (player) (amount of time)
[09.05.2017 23:44:12] xSp4rkz: I 100% agree
[09.05.2017 23:44:13] nightghost2: That would be good
[09.05.2017 23:44:13] ImUnicornRainbow: because them getting out jumping would just le them do it again
[09.05.2017 23:44:18] ImUnicornRainbow: I already told angel
[09.05.2017 23:44:20] ImUnicornRainbow: but he didnt listen
[09.05.2017 23:44:22] xSp4rkz: What im going to do instead of a command
[09.05.2017 23:44:22] ImUnicornRainbow: maybe if you told him
[09.05.2017 23:44:27] ImUnicornRainbow: ?
[09.05.2017 23:44:29] xSp4rkz: Is im going to re-design the cells
[09.05.2017 23:44:38] xSp4rkz: So when you jail someone you will have to place them in a cell
[09.05.2017 23:44:45] xSp4rkz: Which corresponds to the right time
[09.05.2017 23:44:48] xSp4rkz: Sound good?
[09.05.2017 23:44:51] nightghost2: Yea
[09.05.2017 23:44:53] ImUnicornRainbow: Yea
[09.05.2017 23:44:56] xSp4rkz: Perfect
[09.05.2017 23:44:58] nightghost2: I dont understand how we will get them there tho
[09.05.2017 23:45:02] xSp4rkz: Easy

[10.05.2017 01:11:31] nightghost2: Why are we learning math for cops?
[10.05.2017 01:11:33] ImUnicornRainbow: this simplifying has to do with Algebra
[10.05.2017 01:11:41] nightghost2: Shouldnt we be learning other more important stuff
[10.05.2017 01:11:43] ImUnicornRainbow: so lets just say we have uhh....
[10.05.2017 01:12:08] nightghost2: I think we should be learning other stuff
[10.05.2017 01:12:14] ImUnicornRainbow: In distributive property we also do something called inverse operations
[10.05.2017 01:12:14] nightghost2: We dont need to know math for cops
[10.05.2017 01:12:20] ImUnicornRainbow: We are filling in time
[10.05.2017 01:12:29] nightghost2: Cant we just like
[10.05.2017 01:12:32] ImUnicornRainbow: In this we do the opposite of what we did in the equation to find out what our answer is
[10.05.2017 01:12:33] nightghost2: Target practice?\
[10.05.2017 01:12:35] ImUnicornRainbow: SHUSH NIGHT
[10.05.2017 01:12:41] nightghost2: OKKKK
[10.05.2017 01:12:41] ImUnicornRainbow: So..
[10.05.2017 01:12:45] ImUnicornRainbow: lets just say we have ..
[10.05.2017 01:12:54] nightghost2: O
[10.05.2017 01:12:55] nightghost2: ew
[10.05.2017 01:12:57] nightghost2: Oe
[10.05.2017 01:12:58] nightghost2: Ow
[10.05.2017 01:13:00] ImUnicornRainbow: 2(3+4)
[10.05.2017 01:13:01] nightghost2: I shot myself
[10.05.2017 01:13:11] nightghost2: 14
[10.05.2017 01:13:14] ImUnicornRainbow: Sh
[10.05.2017 01:13:19] nightghost2: Thats the awnser
[10.05.2017 01:13:20] nightghost2: 14
[10.05.2017 01:13:21] ImUnicornRainbow: so
[10.05.2017 01:13:27] ImUnicornRainbow: first we do the parenthesis
[10.05.2017 01:13:30] nightghost2: ITS 14
[10.05.2017 01:13:31] ImUnicornRainbow: Like it says PEMDAS
[10.05.2017 01:13:34] ImUnicornRainbow: SH
[10.05.2017 01:13:36] nightghost2: ....
[10.05.2017 01:13:42] nightghost2: WERE WASTING TIME
[10.05.2017 01:13:44] nightghost2: ITS 14
[10.05.2017 01:13:47] ImUnicornRainbow: so then it will be 2(7)
[10.05.2017 01:13:52] nightghost2: 2 x 7 = 14
[10.05.2017 01:13:54] nightghost2: Ik
[10.05.2017 01:13:58] ImUnicornRainbow: Which equals 14..
[10.05.2017 01:14:20] ImUnicornRainbow: now
[10.05.2017 01:14:24] ImUnicornRainbow: How did we find our answer?
[10.05.2017 01:14:31] nightghost2: My head
[10.05.2017 01:14:35] ImUnicornRainbow: Clever.
[10.05.2017 01:14:37] nightghost2: I have the brain of a speedster
[10.05.2017 01:14:39] ImUnicornRainbow: but lets find how we did it
[10.05.2017 01:14:41] ImUnicornRainbow: I mean..
[10.05.2017 01:14:45] ImUnicornRainbow: Lets find out if we are correct.
[10.05.2017 01:14:50] ImUnicornRainbow: So...
[10.05.2017 01:14:51] nightghost2: Were correct
[10.05.2017 01:14:56] nightghost2: You said so yourself
[10.05.2017 01:15:00] ImUnicornRainbow: 2 min detention.
[10.05.2017 01:15:04] nightghost2: Im sorry
[10.05.2017 01:15:14] ImUnicornRainbow: So since the equation was 2(3+4)
[10.05.2017 01:15:19] nightghost2: Ill put a chat timer on my self
[10.05.2017 01:15:19] ImUnicornRainbow: Now to find out if we are correct we do
[10.05.2017 01:15:22] nightghost2: Ill put a chat timer on my self
[10.05.2017 01:15:25] ImUnicornRainbow: 2(3)+2(4)
[10.05.2017 01:15:29] ImUnicornRainbow: which is also 14
[10.05.2017 01:15:34] nightghost2: Timer added
[10.05.2017 01:15:34] ImUnicornRainbow: and that is how we know if we are correct
[10.05.2017 01:15:40] nightghost2: Ok
[10.05.2017 01:15:48] nightghost2: I can only speak every 6 seconds
[10.05.2017 01:15:53] ImUnicornRainbow: Now please read through these notes.. then we will take a quick quiz.
[10.05.2017 01:16:22] nightghost2: This is too confusing
[10.05.2017 01:16:41] ImUnicornRainbow: It is?
[10.05.2017 01:16:44] nightghost2: Yes
[10.05.2017 01:16:46] ImUnicornRainbow: want to go over it alittle more?
[10.05.2017 01:16:50] nightghost2: Im not good at math xD
[10.05.2017 01:16:59] nightghost2: Do we have to learn math can we just learn other stuff
[10.05.2017 01:17:19] ImUnicornRainbow: Lets find a more simple way to explain the notes..
[10.05.2017 01:17:27] nightghost2: Do we really need math?
[10.05.2017 01:17:35] nightghost2: Can we do science
[10.05.2017 01:17:35] ImUnicornRainbow: YES
[10.05.2017 01:17:36] ImUnicornRainbow: SHUT UP
[10.05.2017 01:17:38] ImUnicornRainbow: 4 MIN DETENTION
[10.05.2017 01:17:39] nightghost2: D:
[10.05.2017 01:17:43] nightghost2: Im just saying
[10.05.2017 01:17:49] nightghost2: Can we do science instead
[10.05.2017 01:17:54] nightghost2: THey go hand and hand
[10.05.2017 01:18:10] ImUnicornRainbow: 6 min detention
[10.05.2017 01:18:13] nightghost2: D:
[10.05.2017 01:18:13] ImUnicornRainbow: science is tomorrow
[10.05.2017 01:18:17] nightghost2: Im sowwy
[10.05.2017 01:18:23] ImUnicornRainbow: Okay so..
[10.05.2017 01:18:34] ImUnicornRainbow: Distributive property isnt only to find out how we solve our problem
[10.05.2017 01:18:43] ImUnicornRainbow: we also use it to simplify our expressions
[10.05.2017 01:18:56] ImUnicornRainbow: Lets just say we have 2(v+6)=
[10.05.2017 01:19:03] ImUnicornRainbow: Since we cannto do anything with the v right now
[10.05.2017 01:19:03] nightghost2: Find value of v?
[10.05.2017 01:19:11] ImUnicornRainbow: We just simplify it
[10.05.2017 01:19:12] ImUnicornRainbow: So
[10.05.2017 01:19:25] ImUnicornRainbow: 2(v+6) will be 2(v) + 2(6)
[10.05.2017 01:19:28] ImUnicornRainbow: and what will that equal?
[10.05.2017 01:19:35] nightghost2: Idk what v is
[10.05.2017 01:19:39] ImUnicornRainbow: that will be 2v+12
[10.05.2017 01:19:41] ImUnicornRainbow: we dont find v
[10.05.2017 01:19:45] nightghost2: Oh
[10.05.2017 01:19:45] ImUnicornRainbow: we simplify the fraction
[10.05.2017 01:19:46] nightghost2: 14?
[10.05.2017 01:19:47] ImUnicornRainbow: to make it shorter
[10.05.2017 01:19:50] ImUnicornRainbow: No...
[10.05.2017 01:19:55] ImUnicornRainbow: We dont solve it in other words
[10.05.2017 01:19:58] ImUnicornRainbow: we just simplify it
[10.05.2017 01:19:59] nightghost2: I dont really pay attention in math
[10.05.2017 01:20:06] ImUnicornRainbow: In this the answers will be simplified fractions
[10.05.2017 01:20:10] ImUnicornRainbow: Want more examples?
[10.05.2017 01:20:17] nightghost2: Uh
[10.05.2017 01:20:19] nightghost2: Sure
[10.05.2017 01:20:22] ImUnicornRainbow: Okay
[10.05.2017 01:20:27] ImUnicornRainbow: So..
[10.05.2017 01:20:47] ImUnicornRainbow: we have 5(v+5v+4+5)-5v
[10.05.2017 01:20:52] nightghost2: *faints*
[10.05.2017 01:20:52] ImUnicornRainbow: want a more simple one?
[10.05.2017 01:20:55] nightghost2: Yes
[10.05.2017 01:20:57] nightghost2: Please!
[10.05.2017 01:20:58] ImUnicornRainbow: Okay..
[10.05.2017 01:21:11] ImUnicornRainbow: we have 4(6c+c)
[10.05.2017 01:21:32] ImUnicornRainbow: In this situation since the 6 has a letter with it the letter alone on the other side counts as 1
[10.05.2017 01:21:36] ImUnicornRainbow: so the 6c will be 7c
[10.05.2017 01:21:42] ImUnicornRainbow: 4 x 6c
[10.05.2017 01:21:46] ImUnicornRainbow: which is 24c
[10.05.2017 01:22:09] ImUnicornRainbow: get it?
[10.05.2017 01:22:13] ImUnicornRainbow: We make the equations shorter
[10.05.2017 01:22:18] nightghost2: Yes
[10.05.2017 01:22:21] ImUnicornRainbow: Ready for the quiz?
[10.05.2017 01:22:25] ImUnicornRainbow: Or want more examples?
[10.05.2017 01:22:26] nightghost2: As ill ever be
[10.05.2017 01:22:30] nightghost2: Give the quiz
[10.05.2017 01:22:32] ImUnicornRainbow: Okay

[10.05.2017 01:22:54] nightghost2: Uh
[10.05.2017 01:22:58] nightghost2: Can we skip math or no?
[10.05.2017 01:23:04] ImUnicornRainbow: its just 3 questions..
[10.05.2017 01:23:06] ImUnicornRainbow: try your best
[10.05.2017 01:23:07] ImUnicornRainbow: xD

[13.05.2017 04:11:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: ./warp <player> <reason> is now a command, as nightghost saw earlier
[13.05.2017 04:11:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: warn*
[13.05.2017 04:11:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: not warp
[13.05.2017 04:11:42] HerpaDerp10000: yes sir
[13.05.2017 04:11:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: when you warn someone or arrest someone
[13.05.2017 04:11:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: it goes on their permanent record
[13.05.2017 04:12:00] nightghost2: WOah what is this college
[13.05.2017 04:12:08] HerpaDerp10000: isnt that a little much?
[13.05.2017 04:12:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: as of right now there is no way to remove something from the permanent record and i will probably keep it that way
[13.05.2017 04:12:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: so when you "jail" someone for fun, it will forever be on their record
[13.05.2017 04:12:26] God_Doesnt_Exist: now then
[13.05.2017 04:12:26] nightghost2: No fun jailing

[13.05.2017 04:13:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: or have been jailed before
[13.05.2017 04:13:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: no your background is not there

[13.05.2017 16:54:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: but the new police system is done
[13.05.2017 16:54:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: and i need you to inform all the officers
[13.05.2017 16:54:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: do you have GMC here can u build shit
[13.05.2017 16:54:43] ImUnicornRainbow: Yes.
[13.05.2017 16:54:45] God_Doesnt_Exist: oaky
[13.05.2017 16:54:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: ./arrest is now different
[13.05.2017 16:54:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: ./arrest <player> <reason>
[13.05.2017 16:55:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: if you do not provide a reason it will say "unknown command"
[13.05.2017 16:55:20] ImUnicornRainbow: Can I write it down while you write?
[13.05.2017 16:55:26] God_Doesnt_Exist: yea sure
[13.05.2017 16:56:03] ImUnicornRainbow: There.
[13.05.2017 16:56:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: ./warn <player> <reason>. This displays a bigass red message in chat that the player was warned by the officer and that that player needs to visit /warp rules. its visible to everyone
[13.05.2017 16:56:17] ImUnicornRainbow: FINALLY! I Told him to add that but he said no ;-;
[13.05.2017 16:57:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: its like "playerABC was warned by officer WHOEVER on the grounds of SOME FUCKING MESSAGE. please visit /warp rules to understand our policies" or something like that
[13.05.2017 16:57:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: tthats the message everyone sees
[13.05.2017 16:57:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: i mean u dont have to write that down
[13.05.2017 16:57:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: im just tellin u
[13.05.2017 16:57:26] ImUnicornRainbow: Im writing it to put it in their mails.
[13.05.2017 16:57:26] God_Doesnt_Exist: um next is
[13.05.2017 16:57:34] ImUnicornRainbow: mail*
[13.05.2017 16:57:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: maybe u should just write some signs in the police station
[13.05.2017 16:57:40] God_Doesnt_Exist: that ppl will see
[13.05.2017 16:57:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: idk
[13.05.2017 16:57:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: i always take the lazy approach if it works lol
[13.05.2017 16:57:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: anywway
[13.05.2017 16:58:01] ImUnicornRainbow: Oh, SP4rks wrote things down and put it in their mail cause they check it every day to get their money.
[13.05.2017 16:58:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay so every time a player has been warned or arrested, it goes into the CRIMINAL DATABASE :o
[13.05.2017 16:58:17] ImUnicornRainbow: :o
[13.05.2017 16:58:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: and that means that police now have a new command
[13.05.2017 16:58:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: ./backgroundcheck <player> it will list a players previous offenses and warnings
[13.05.2017 16:58:38] God_Doesnt_Exist: and their reasons
[13.05.2017 16:58:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: and dates and times
[13.05.2017 16:59:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: isnt dis fun so far :o i bet u were like 'fuck a meeting with angel this is bad'
[13.05.2017 16:59:28] ImUnicornRainbow: No, I like meetings.
[13.05.2017 16:59:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: and its NOT EVEN OVER DERS MOAR COMMAND :O
[13.05.2017 16:59:34] ImUnicornRainbow: makes me feel important.
[13.05.2017 16:59:38] ImUnicornRainbow: :ooo
[13.05.2017 16:59:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: now u also get /checkfingerprints <player>
[13.05.2017 17:00:01] ImUnicornRainbow: :ooo fancy
[13.05.2017 17:00:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: and every time a player is arrested or warned, their IP gets logged
[13.05.2017 17:00:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: so that means
[13.05.2017 17:00:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: u can use /checkfingerprints to search for peoples ALT accounts :ooooo
[13.05.2017 17:01:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: so like /checkfingerprints KCocco would say that JumpmanC and someOtherAlt share IPs
[13.05.2017 17:01:20] God_Doesnt_Exist: so you could deduce they are probs alts
[13.05.2017 17:01:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: its like an investigation technique
[13.05.2017 17:01:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: :ooo
[13.05.2017 17:01:32] ImUnicornRainbow: Like batman :ooo
[13.05.2017 17:01:50] God_Doesnt_Exist: it only works tho if both alts have been entered in the criminal database
[13.05.2017 17:02:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: mebbe
[13.05.2017 17:02:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: ooo
[13.05.2017 17:02:26] ImUnicornRainbow: :o wut
[13.05.2017 17:02:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: hm ima have to upgrade that i thought of a way to make it a bit better
[13.05.2017 17:02:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: someone doesnt HAVE to be in the database
[13.05.2017 17:02:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: but if some random player is misbehaving, u can run their IP through the database to see if they have any alts on file
[13.05.2017 17:02:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: :o
[13.05.2017 17:02:59] ImUnicornRainbow: :oooo
[13.05.2017 17:03:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: okie
[13.05.2017 17:03:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: so ders another commend yet! :ooooo
[13.05.2017 17:03:11] ImUnicornRainbow: :ooooooo
[13.05.2017 17:03:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: only for sergeants! :oooo
[13.05.2017 17:03:19] ImUnicornRainbow: *gasps* :ooo
[13.05.2017 17:03:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: ./officerhistory <player> will check another officers warning and arrest histories
[13.05.2017 17:03:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: so like u can see all the ppl that nightghost has warned or arrested
[13.05.2017 17:03:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: idk if its useful but it might be
[13.05.2017 17:03:58] ImUnicornRainbow: This feels like an award show xD "AND NOW HERE COMES THE OTHER AWARD! 10000 DOLLARS!!!"
[13.05.2017 17:04:43] God_Doesnt_Exist: so ye, every time a player is warned or arrested it all gets saved now
[13.05.2017 17:04:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think its neat
[13.05.2017 17:04:50] ImUnicornRainbow: Ya
[13.05.2017 17:04:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: feels more like police
[13.05.2017 17:04:59] ImUnicornRainbow: mhm
[13.05.2017 17:05:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: alrighty i think that covers it
[13.05.2017 17:05:21] ImUnicornRainbow: kewl new commands
[13.05.2017 17:05:28] God_Doesnt_Exist: just tell all the other officers and sergeants about it pls
[13.05.2017 17:05:28] ImUnicornRainbow: I wish there were more criminals on this server lol
[13.05.2017 17:05:31] ImUnicornRainbow: I will
[13.05.2017 17:05:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: so they know how to arrest ppl
[13.05.2017 17:05:34] ImUnicornRainbow: Dont worry.
[13.05.2017 17:05:40] God_Doesnt_Exist: the /warn will be nice tho
[13.05.2017 17:05:43] ImUnicornRainbow: It will..
[13.05.2017 17:05:49] ImUnicornRainbow: I told Sp4rks about it he said, "that isnt needed"
[13.05.2017 17:05:56] ImUnicornRainbow: well now I see he just said that to take the credit xD
[13.05.2017 17:05:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: i said that too for a while
[13.05.2017 17:06:02] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think it is needed tho
[13.05.2017 17:06:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: and its nice to check peoples history
[13.05.2017 17:06:12] ImUnicornRainbow: Yeah because people dont take "first warning" seriously.
[13.05.2017 17:06:22] ImUnicornRainbow: that too...... helps us, a lot.
[13.05.2017 17:07:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: i feel like that seriously ties it in really good witht he police station, like it feels like a REAL police station now
[13.05.2017 17:07:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: where u can check for peoples priors
[13.05.2017 17:07:29] ImUnicornRainbow: Angel
[13.05.2017 17:07:39] ImUnicornRainbow: I also want to tell you something about other than the police station.
[13.05.2017 17:07:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: man nigga
[13.05.2017 17:07:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: man lol

[13.05.2017 17:09:24] God_Doesnt_Exist: which i was thinking of offering camel, but ive tried like 100 times before with her, she can only build "her way"
[13.05.2017 17:09:34] ImUnicornRainbow: Yeah..
[13.05.2017 17:09:37] ImUnicornRainbow: she is a free builder.
[13.05.2017 17:09:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: she has no power to work with others
[13.05.2017 17:09:50] ImUnicornRainbow: She would also grief if she gets angry xD
[13.05.2017 17:10:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: hm i dont think so
[13.05.2017 17:10:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: ive never seen her do that
[13.05.2017 17:10:11] God_Doesnt_Exist: i mean maybe
[13.05.2017 17:10:13] ImUnicornRainbow: She did it to Harley
[13.05.2017 17:10:18] ImUnicornRainbow: she put dicks on her statues
[13.05.2017 17:10:22] ImUnicornRainbow: and made them naked

[22.05.2017 02:21:09] HerpaDerp10000: me and officers didnt know what to do with him we were powerless becuase he was spamming commands and it cause a fuss and everyone thought he was awesome for spamming and just being a total jerk
[22.05.2017 02:21:22] xSp4rkz: Why wasnt he jailed?
[22.05.2017 02:21:30] HerpaDerp10000: we arrested him warned him everything

[27.05.2017 14:15:28] WhatAreThose05: Correct?
[27.05.2017 14:16:03] xSp4rkz: I didnt know
[27.05.2017 14:16:04] WhatAreThose05: Well um, he isnt following his labels......... there are so many books on the applications chest that he said he read but I dont know which ones have not been checked and which have been checked.
[27.05.2017 14:16:25] WhatAreThose05: I have read a stack of applications then put them in the read applications
[27.05.2017 14:16:32] WhatAreThose05: he just keeps them in the "have to reaD" chest
[27.05.2017 14:16:43] WhatAreThose05: and um
[27.05.2017 14:16:44] xSp4rkz: wtf
[27.05.2017 14:16:55] xSp4rkz: Yeah just keep reading them then and put them in the read chest
[27.05.2017 14:16:58] WhatAreThose05: I've heard that some officers have been giving complains about him.
[27.05.2017 14:17:06] WhatAreThose05: complaints*
[27.05.2017 14:17:10] xSp4rkz: Yeah I've received a couple
[27.05.2017 14:17:19] xSp4rkz: One from GDE too about griefing
[27.05.2017 14:17:26] WhatAreThose05: Yeah and um.
[27.05.2017 14:17:36] xSp4rkz: If you check his background I warned him, I dunno if he even noticed
[27.05.2017 14:17:51] WhatAreThose05: In the training academy as well he isnt prepared for his classes..
[27.05.2017 14:18:10] xSp4rkz: i'll talk to him see where is head is at
[27.05.2017 14:18:17] WhatAreThose05: oh and
[27.05.2017 14:18:25] WhatAreThose05: I've been noticing that he only does his work when you are on
[27.05.2017 14:18:35] xSp4rkz: Interesting
[27.05.2017 14:18:49] WhatAreThose05: like I've been seeing that he hasnt been giving interviews... the only time he gave an interview these past weeks was when you were on.
[27.05.2017 14:19:05] WhatAreThose05: Other times he is just chilling here talking to others in chat
[27.05.2017 14:19:16] xSp4rkz: Np. I'll look into it :)
[27.05.2017 14:19:19] WhatAreThose05: Oh and
[27.05.2017 14:20:06] WhatAreThose05: I also wanted to ask if you could make a thingy Head Sergeant or Manager to watch if Sergeants are doing their work while you are not on and give it to someone you think would be responsible enough.
[27.05.2017 14:20:08] WhatAreThose05: to solve this problem.
[27.05.2017 14:20:22] WhatAreThose05: Because in the future there might be other sergeants who are not doing their job correctly.
[27.05.2017 14:20:46] xSp4rkz: I may do something like that. I'll have to toy with that idea
[27.05.2017 14:21:00] WhatAreThose05: great.
[27.05.2017 14:21:01] xSp4rkz: Right now if im not on, GDE takes over and when I come on he backs off
[27.05.2017 14:21:09] xSp4rkz: But thats something we can do too
[27.05.2017 14:21:21] xSp4rkz: We have a new idea for a jail too
[27.05.2017 14:21:21] WhatAreThose05: Yeah because GDE is mostly busy with codes
[27.05.2017 14:21:28] WhatAreThose05: and goes afk a lot working on the server's plugins.
[27.05.2017 14:21:38] xSp4rkz: Yeah. Lots of bugs
[27.05.2017 14:21:54] WhatAreThose05: Im sorry xD
