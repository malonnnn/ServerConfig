[26.04.2017 03:48:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: what does "population of sales" mean?

[26.04.2017 03:48:44] SpyJay_YT: Yes.
[26.04.2017 03:48:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: you're still describing salesman, tbh
[26.04.2017 03:49:01] SpyJay_YT: Not really
[26.04.2017 03:49:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes really
[26.04.2017 03:49:09] SpyJay_YT: You're making this sound complicated lad

[26.04.2017 03:49:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: my point is that any company will hire a salesman like that, they are a dime a dozen. i guess if you want to work as a salesman for the rest of your life, then you were correct, you really can get job offers thrown at you
[26.04.2017 03:50:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay ur right we can be done

[26.04.2017 05:04:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: probs not, cuz even as you said, "you know a way to make huge money"
[26.04.2017 05:04:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: too much potential to be abused
[26.04.2017 05:05:06] SpyJay_YT: uh
[26.04.2017 05:05:09] SpyJay_YT: when did I say that?
[26.04.2017 05:05:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: oh maybe it wasnt you
[26.04.2017 05:05:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: even so, i dont think so
[26.04.2017 05:05:24] SpyJay_YT: I said I know how to win a battle easier
[26.04.2017 05:05:25] SpyJay_YT: lol
[26.04.2017 05:05:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: it might have been someone else
[26.04.2017 05:05:38] SpyJay_YT: You see, everyone is spamming hits, as if this was 1.8
[26.04.2017 05:05:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah
[26.04.2017 05:05:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: exactly
[26.04.2017 05:05:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: dis aint 1.8
[26.04.2017 05:05:52] SpyJay_YT: But since 1.9 you have to hit at the right times
[26.04.2017 05:05:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats my secret
[26.04.2017 05:05:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: let that bar refill
[26.04.2017 05:06:00] God_Doesnt_Exist: and get crits
[26.04.2017 05:06:12] SpyJay_YT: I mean, you can spam, but it won't do as much damage
[26.04.2017 05:06:29] SpyJay_YT: Thats why I've seen people do 2 hearts damage in one hit
[26.04.2017 05:06:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: but it's about balance
[26.04.2017 05:06:32] SpyJay_YT: yep
[26.04.2017 05:06:45] God_Doesnt_Exist: i spam sometimes when my opponent is out of view and im searching to get my crosshairs back on him
[26.04.2017 05:06:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: but if ive got good shots, then well-timed shots is where it lies
[26.04.2017 05:07:14] SpyJay_YT: So, what else is stopping me from being aref
[26.04.2017 05:07:16] SpyJay_YT: a ref*
[26.04.2017 05:07:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: that i probs won't let anyone be a ref
[26.04.2017 05:07:31] SpyJay_YT: I mean, you're the only person who can do offical fights
[26.04.2017 05:07:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: right
[26.04.2017 05:07:44] SpyJay_YT: and, it wouldn't hurt to have a side person do it
[26.04.2017 05:07:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: it could hurt
[26.04.2017 05:08:13] SpyJay_YT: how?
[26.04.2017 05:08:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: all it takes is one thrown fight and one bad call
[26.04.2017 05:08:41] SpyJay_YT: what do you mean?
[26.04.2017 05:08:56] SpyJay_YT: You do know I'm basically asking for perms to do /offical?
[26.04.2017 05:09:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes i do and im declining that
[26.04.2017 05:09:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: its too easy to abuse
[26.04.2017 05:09:35] SpyJay_YT: Gde, I don't even know/understand how it can be abused, what harm can I do?
[26.04.2017 05:09:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: a thrown fight with people betting on the underdog would cause huge payouts
[26.04.2017 05:10:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: ask u saw earlier with our 7.25k win
[26.04.2017 05:10:25] SpyJay_YT: What do you mean by
[26.04.2017 05:10:27] SpyJay_YT: thrown fight
[26.04.2017 05:10:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: when a fight is thrown that means someone loses on purpose
[26.04.2017 05:11:04] SpyJay_YT: Dude, I have nothing to do with competitors, I'm basically turning a fight into
[26.04.2017 05:11:15] SpyJay_YT: record fight
[26.04.2017 05:11:24] SpyJay_YT: Oh.. I understand now
[26.04.2017 05:11:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: i suppose i could give you a command that records wins/losses but no bets
[26.04.2017 05:11:55] SpyJay_YT: Dude I won't do anything to harm bets, honestly
[26.04.2017 05:12:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: just like 20 minutes ago u were telling me to make the fight official where i /killed him
[26.04.2017 05:12:37] The_Erbinator: bdvs
[26.04.2017 05:12:39] SpyJay_YT: I didn't know you /killed him
[26.04.2017 05:12:43] SpyJay_YT: and
[26.04.2017 05:12:51] SpyJay_YT: I was reffering to when I put a bet down
[26.04.2017 05:13:09] SpyJay_YT: I didn't mean anything by it, I just said it wasn't official
[26.04.2017 05:13:14] SpyJay_YT: thats why i didnt win money
[26.04.2017 05:13:17] SpyJay_YT: thats all I was saying
[26.04.2017 05:13:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: i know, but my point is you didnt even notice the chat that said "god_doesnt_exist exploded the body of aldrin"
[26.04.2017 05:13:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: so idk how good of a ref u can really be
[26.04.2017 05:14:04] God_Doesnt_Exist: like the fight was like 5 seconds long and u somehow didnt notice
[26.04.2017 05:14:07] SpyJay_YT: Me not knowing how someone died, doesn't really have anything to do with it
[26.04.2017 05:14:20] SpyJay_YT: You're staff, with all perms
[26.04.2017 05:14:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah it does when it literalyl says it right next to who won and how they won
[26.04.2017 05:14:22] SpyJay_YT: normally
[26.04.2017 05:14:29] SpyJay_YT: a fight can only end by fist
[26.04.2017 05:14:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: u can see the same death messages i do
[26.04.2017 05:14:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: obviously not
[26.04.2017 05:14:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: i /killed him
[26.04.2017 05:14:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: ppl can also try to escape and they die
[26.04.2017 05:14:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: so u dont even know all the rules
[26.04.2017 05:14:57] SpyJay_YT: I said normally..
[26.04.2017 05:15:00] SpyJay_YT: not always
[26.04.2017 05:15:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: so what are you getting it?
[26.04.2017 05:15:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: at*
[26.04.2017 05:15:24] SpyJay_YT: What I'm saying is
[26.04.2017 05:16:03] SpyJay_YT: I mainly didn't notice it because I'm used to ppl being killed by fist, even escape deaths rarely happened, it's normal for me to not realize a different death
[26.04.2017 05:16:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: if its normal for you not realize different deaths, then i have to decline you as ref as i need a ref who that's not normal for
[26.04.2017 05:17:17] SpyJay_YT: I don't understand how me seeing how a person dies is so important dude
[26.04.2017 05:17:26] SpyJay_YT: I'm simply wanted to let people earn money when you're too busy
[26.04.2017 05:17:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: people can earn money while im busy
[26.04.2017 05:17:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats what serverwork and money room is for
[26.04.2017 05:17:43] SpyJay_YT: in fights
[26.04.2017 05:17:52] SpyJay_YT: enjoying themselves
[26.04.2017 05:18:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes but as i said, its too easy to abuse and the only person i trust is xsparkz
[26.04.2017 05:18:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: plus i play quite often, thers plenty of official fights
[26.04.2017 05:18:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: plus i play quite often, thers plenty of official fights
[26.04.2017 05:18:30] SpyJay_YT: I seriously don't know how this became a federal case
[26.04.2017 05:18:33] SpyJay_YT: How about this:
[26.04.2017 05:18:56] SpyJay_YT: I get the ability to host offical fights, and if I don't do well, it gets taken away, no questions asked.
[26.04.2017 05:19:02] SpyJay_YT: only 1 chance
[26.04.2017 05:19:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: no because its too hard to track abuse
[26.04.2017 05:19:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: thers no good way to track it
[26.04.2017 05:19:37] SpyJay_YT: but you're on often
[26.04.2017 05:19:38] SpyJay_YT: :L
[26.04.2017 05:19:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: if thats your argument then we dont need another ref
[26.04.2017 05:20:22] SpyJay_YT: :L
[26.04.2017 05:20:28] SpyJay_YT: Can I please have one chance
[26.04.2017 05:20:40] SpyJay_YT: We go way back, you should be able to trust my word.
[26.04.2017 05:20:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: what do you mean we go way back?
[26.04.2017 05:20:59] SpyJay_YT: I've played this server for a while
[26.04.2017 05:20:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think you've only been playing here like a year
[26.04.2017 05:21:09] SpyJay_YT: eh, year and a half
[26.04.2017 05:21:24] SpyJay_YT: This might be a 6 year old server
[26.04.2017 05:21:27] SpyJay_YT: but
[26.04.2017 05:21:37] SpyJay_YT: That's pretty long in my world
[26.04.2017 05:22:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: if i were to give it to you
[26.04.2017 05:22:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: i can tell you what would happen
[26.04.2017 05:22:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: it would go good for like a day or two
[26.04.2017 05:23:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: then you're going to make a bad call
[26.04.2017 05:23:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: it'll get removed
[26.04.2017 05:23:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: and you will get angry
[26.04.2017 05:23:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: and you will say "you were just looking for any reason to take it away"
[26.04.2017 05:23:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: and i won't be able to deny that claim
[26.04.2017 05:23:28] SpyJay_YT: Then give me a chance to prove it wrong
[26.04.2017 05:23:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: you read what i said?
[26.04.2017 05:23:58] SpyJay_YT: I honestly don't see how I can make a bad call
[26.04.2017 05:24:11] SpyJay_YT: Here's the way I think of it Gde
[26.04.2017 05:24:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is something like calling it official when someone tries to escape
[26.04.2017 05:24:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is calling it official when someone is afk
[26.04.2017 05:24:45] SpyJay_YT: I think of it has being able to host fights that money are won from, you're putting the ideas in my head by saying why not.
[26.04.2017 05:24:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is calling it when someone is partially afk
[26.04.2017 05:25:15] SpyJay_YT: Gde I can't make it offical if the battle started already tho?
[26.04.2017 05:25:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is when someone has a technical issue
[26.04.2017 05:25:28] God_Doesnt_Exist: right it can only be called after
[26.04.2017 05:25:47] SpyJay_YT: Gde, I won't do that
[26.04.2017 05:25:49] SpyJay_YT: I promise
[26.04.2017 05:26:26] SpyJay_YT: If I see that both competitors are ready, no one afk or holding still odly, I'll make it offical,
[26.04.2017 05:26:29] SpyJay_YT: but
[26.04.2017 05:26:41] SpyJay_YT: if they just pause in the middle of a fight
[26.04.2017 05:26:45] SpyJay_YT: I can't control that
[26.04.2017 05:27:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: im not asking you to control that
[26.04.2017 05:27:11] SpyJay_YT: Ik
[26.04.2017 05:27:13] SpyJay_YT: Im js
[26.04.2017 05:27:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: it has nothing to do with controlling that idk why you even brought that up
[26.04.2017 05:27:16] SpyJay_YT: incase it happens
[26.04.2017 05:27:26] SpyJay_YT: I was js
[26.04.2017 05:27:40] SpyJay_YT: Gde, I won't let you down.
[26.04.2017 05:28:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: alright i MAY allow it
[26.04.2017 05:28:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: ask me again tomorrow
[26.04.2017 05:28:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: im not convinced yet
[26.04.2017 05:28:42] SpyJay_YT: Ok
[26.04.2017 05:28:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: but your argument is favorable
[26.04.2017 05:28:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: so ask me tomorrow

[26.04.2017 05:30:00] SpyJay_YT: is it favorable
[26.04.2017 05:30:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: the words
[26.04.2017 05:30:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: are
[26.04.2017 05:31:13] SpyJay_YT: hmm
[26.04.2017 05:31:19] SpyJay_YT: I kinda understand now
[26.04.2017 05:31:21] SpyJay_YT: ok
[26.04.2017 05:31:32] SpyJay_YT: Like
[26.04.2017 05:31:39] SpyJay_YT: It's showing
[26.04.2017 05:31:48] SpyJay_YT: worthiness? or should be approved
[26.04.2017 05:31:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes you could define it as such
[26.04.2017 05:32:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: so yeah thats the gist
[26.04.2017 05:32:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: ask me tomorrow
[26.04.2017 05:32:56] SpyJay_YT: Ok
[26.04.2017 05:32:57] SpyJay_YT: gn

[27.04.2017 01:27:34] _Vigilance_: Wait, God_Doesnt_Exist, what if you had a police force, and a main gang? The gang would be the opposite of the police force, they would all be evil n shit and spread crime, so there would be 2 opposite forces, sparking RP
[27.04.2017 01:27:35] Razara_Cheshire: don't you give me that dumb excuse. I don't believe it for a second

[27.04.2017 01:39:56] Razara_Cheshire: How would you like it if we took your stuff and used it to destroy your base for no reason?
[27.04.2017 01:40:01] Waggity: 4 stacks of gold
[27.04.2017 01:40:02] _Vigilance_: So God_Doesnt_Exist, how about that Good/Bad idea?
[27.04.2017 01:40:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: raz

[27.04.2017 01:42:00] Razara_Cheshire: Why couldn't you have just destroyed Tony and leave my faction alone?
[27.04.2017 01:42:04] _Vigilance_: What should our fac name be?
[27.04.2017 01:42:05] Waggity: Im not a Bad guy or a Good guy

[27.04.2017 01:42:43] Archieous: They can remain neutral
[27.04.2017 01:42:45] Archieous: Undecided
[27.04.2017 01:42:47] _Vigilance_: They chose to be a mortal and be safe from murder

[27.04.2017 01:43:12] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: with anyone?
[27.04.2017 01:43:16] Archieous: Undecided people could buy guns
[27.04.2017 01:43:19] HerpaDerp10000: thats a bad idea
[27.04.2017 01:43:23] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:23] HerpaDerp10000: its dumb
[27.04.2017 01:43:25] _Vigilance_: Villains: Kill Heroes | Heroes: Kill Villains | Neutrals: Can't pvp
[27.04.2017 01:43:25] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:27] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:28] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:29] Waggity: Razara is finally catching on
[27.04.2017 01:43:35] _Vigilance_: Villains: Kill Heroes | Heroes: Kill Villains | Neutrals: Can't pvp
[27.04.2017 01:43:38] Razara_Cheshire: I have been saying that
[27.04.2017 01:43:41] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:49] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire that already happens
[27.04.2017 01:43:55] Waggity: Ill pvp for sure
[27.04.2017 01:43:59] HerpaDerp10000: that should be a minigame duh
[27.04.2017 01:44:07] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire ppl can already become op and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:44:10] Razara_Cheshire: I know. Having a full team of evil people doing it is worse though
[27.04.2017 01:44:11] Waggity: I fight weak heroes
[27.04.2017 01:44:22] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire that can happen any time
[27.04.2017 01:44:22] Waggity: Like that kid "Percy Jackson"
[27.04.2017 01:44:29] Archieous: lol
[27.04.2017 01:44:42] Razara_Cheshire: Having a team of people doing it is worse
[27.04.2017 01:44:45] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire we could take all the ops's and kill everyone as it is right now
[27.04.2017 01:45:12] Razara_Cheshire: I don't care. You destroyed my faction. If you had waited, Tony probably would have been kicked out of it
[27.04.2017 01:45:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: i'm rejecting your idea.
[27.04.2017 01:45:18] Razara_Cheshire: Tony is a dick

[27.04.2017 01:46:14] Razara_Cheshire: Bastards and Selfish Idiots
[27.04.2017 01:46:19] Waggity: Dark Heroes
[27.04.2017 01:46:28] Razara_Cheshire: I like mine better. You're no heroes
[27.04.2017 01:46:41] _Vigilance_: Ben
[27.04.2017 01:46:42] Waggity: We save people
[27.04.2017 01:46:48] _Vigilance_: I have an Axe
[27.04.2017 01:46:59] Archieous: okay
[27.04.2017 01:47:00] Razara_Cheshire: YEAH CERTAINLY SAVED ME WHEN YOU DESTROYED MY BASE AND KILLED ME
[27.04.2017 01:47:05] Waggity: We should name our faction Dark Heroes
[27.04.2017 01:47:09] Waggity: Yup
[27.04.2017 01:47:17] Razara_Cheshire: I hate you
[27.04.2017 01:47:18] Waggity: We saved it from happening later
[27.04.2017 01:47:24] _Vigilance_: Wait, why dont we change the name to: "The Mercenaries"
[27.04.2017 01:47:25] Razara_Cheshire: ...
[27.04.2017 01:47:36] _Vigilance_: We should be The Mercenaries
[27.04.2017 01:47:44] Waggity: Yeah
[27.04.2017 01:47:45] _Vigilance_: Because we're neutral
[27.04.2017 01:47:54] Waggity: Nice
[27.04.2017 01:48:00] _Vigilance_: we will fight if paid, and we do what we want
[27.04.2017 01:48:07] _Vigilance_: Perfect name
[27.04.2017 01:48:08] Archieous: Now we make power faster
[27.04.2017 01:48:09] Waggity: Nice
[27.04.2017 01:48:10] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, how many plots do you think it'll take to replicate a base like that?
[27.04.2017 01:48:28] Waggity: Lets plan our next attack
[27.04.2017 01:48:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: plots?
[27.04.2017 01:48:30] _Vigilance_: We dont even need a base, we just need one thing... I'll set it up in a sec

[27.04.2017 01:48:48] Razara_Cheshire: If we make it on plots, they literally can't break it
[27.04.2017 01:48:57] Archieous: Your base was 8 chucks
[27.04.2017 01:49:05] Archieous: But we took away 3
[27.04.2017 01:49:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats true powergirl you should be able to do it in 2 plots
[27.04.2017 01:49:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: 4 would look the best tho
[27.04.2017 01:49:25] Razara_Cheshire: Thanks. I'll mail Camull about it

[27.04.2017 04:41:45] Bitslane: what does rooting do?
[27.04.2017 04:41:50] _Vigilance_: My friend has hacked games with his rooted tablet :P
[27.04.2017 04:41:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: rooting unlocks ur phone so itsnot locked down by the manufacturer
[27.04.2017 04:42:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: like theres apps and shit on ur phone u cant uninstall
[27.04.2017 04:42:12] Bitslane: oh okay
[27.04.2017 04:42:13] _Vigilance_: Idk if I should root my phone
[27.04.2017 04:42:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: but rooting would allow you to delete them
[27.04.2017 04:42:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: to a degree
[27.04.2017 04:42:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: you can also install adblockers
[27.04.2017 04:42:32] _Vigilance_: because it might mess up my mom's parental thing and cause her to flip out
[27.04.2017 04:42:36] Bitslane: just sounds like a waste of time
[27.04.2017 04:42:37] HerpaDerp10000: 1 free in app purchases 2 change the interface 3 more apps 4 modify ur apps boost things and etc
[27.04.2017 04:42:52] _Vigilance_: ;-; I want to root it ;-;

[27.04.2017 04:43:24] _Vigilance_: But it will probably fuck with my mom's parental setup and she'll flip out so I probably cant D:
[27.04.2017 04:43:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: i wouldn't advise it
[27.04.2017 04:43:39] _Vigilance_: Sad D:
[27.04.2017 04:43:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: the reason why i like the nexus 5 is because its the only phone that actually doesnt come locked down
[27.04.2017 04:44:03] Bitslane: I could care less about that
[27.04.2017 04:44:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: ik
[27.04.2017 04:44:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: rooting is pretty worthless, herpa wasn't able to asnwer my questions
[27.04.2017 04:44:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: ppl like to claim its the best thing ever, but its not really that great
