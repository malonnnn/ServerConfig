[26.04.2017 03:48:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: what does "population of sales" mean?

[26.04.2017 03:48:44] SpyJay_YT: Yes.
[26.04.2017 03:48:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: you're still describing salesman, tbh
[26.04.2017 03:49:01] SpyJay_YT: Not really
[26.04.2017 03:49:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes really
[26.04.2017 03:49:09] SpyJay_YT: You're making this sound complicated lad

[26.04.2017 03:49:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: my point is that any company will hire a salesman like that, they are a dime a dozen. i guess if you want to work as a salesman for the rest of your life, then you were correct, you really can get job offers thrown at you
[26.04.2017 03:50:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay ur right we can be done

[26.04.2017 05:04:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: probs not, cuz even as you said, "you know a way to make huge money"
[26.04.2017 05:04:56] God_Doesnt_Exist: too much potential to be abused
[26.04.2017 05:05:06] SpyJay_YT: uh
[26.04.2017 05:05:09] SpyJay_YT: when did I say that?
[26.04.2017 05:05:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: oh maybe it wasnt you
[26.04.2017 05:05:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: even so, i dont think so
[26.04.2017 05:05:24] SpyJay_YT: I said I know how to win a battle easier
[26.04.2017 05:05:25] SpyJay_YT: lol
[26.04.2017 05:05:31] God_Doesnt_Exist: it might have been someone else
[26.04.2017 05:05:38] SpyJay_YT: You see, everyone is spamming hits, as if this was 1.8
[26.04.2017 05:05:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah
[26.04.2017 05:05:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: exactly
[26.04.2017 05:05:52] God_Doesnt_Exist: dis aint 1.8
[26.04.2017 05:05:52] SpyJay_YT: But since 1.9 you have to hit at the right times
[26.04.2017 05:05:54] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats my secret
[26.04.2017 05:05:58] God_Doesnt_Exist: let that bar refill
[26.04.2017 05:06:00] God_Doesnt_Exist: and get crits
[26.04.2017 05:06:12] SpyJay_YT: I mean, you can spam, but it won't do as much damage
[26.04.2017 05:06:29] SpyJay_YT: Thats why I've seen people do 2 hearts damage in one hit
[26.04.2017 05:06:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: but it's about balance
[26.04.2017 05:06:32] SpyJay_YT: yep
[26.04.2017 05:06:45] God_Doesnt_Exist: i spam sometimes when my opponent is out of view and im searching to get my crosshairs back on him
[26.04.2017 05:06:55] God_Doesnt_Exist: but if ive got good shots, then well-timed shots is where it lies
[26.04.2017 05:07:14] SpyJay_YT: So, what else is stopping me from being aref
[26.04.2017 05:07:16] SpyJay_YT: a ref*
[26.04.2017 05:07:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: that i probs won't let anyone be a ref
[26.04.2017 05:07:31] SpyJay_YT: I mean, you're the only person who can do offical fights
[26.04.2017 05:07:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: right
[26.04.2017 05:07:44] SpyJay_YT: and, it wouldn't hurt to have a side person do it
[26.04.2017 05:07:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: it could hurt
[26.04.2017 05:08:13] SpyJay_YT: how?
[26.04.2017 05:08:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: all it takes is one thrown fight and one bad call
[26.04.2017 05:08:41] SpyJay_YT: what do you mean?
[26.04.2017 05:08:56] SpyJay_YT: You do know I'm basically asking for perms to do /offical?
[26.04.2017 05:09:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes i do and im declining that
[26.04.2017 05:09:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: its too easy to abuse
[26.04.2017 05:09:35] SpyJay_YT: Gde, I don't even know/understand how it can be abused, what harm can I do?
[26.04.2017 05:09:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: a thrown fight with people betting on the underdog would cause huge payouts
[26.04.2017 05:10:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: ask u saw earlier with our 7.25k win
[26.04.2017 05:10:25] SpyJay_YT: What do you mean by
[26.04.2017 05:10:27] SpyJay_YT: thrown fight
[26.04.2017 05:10:39] God_Doesnt_Exist: when a fight is thrown that means someone loses on purpose
[26.04.2017 05:11:04] SpyJay_YT: Dude, I have nothing to do with competitors, I'm basically turning a fight into
[26.04.2017 05:11:15] SpyJay_YT: record fight
[26.04.2017 05:11:24] SpyJay_YT: Oh.. I understand now
[26.04.2017 05:11:32] God_Doesnt_Exist: i suppose i could give you a command that records wins/losses but no bets
[26.04.2017 05:11:55] SpyJay_YT: Dude I won't do anything to harm bets, honestly
[26.04.2017 05:12:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: just like 20 minutes ago u were telling me to make the fight official where i /killed him
[26.04.2017 05:12:37] The_Erbinator: bdvs
[26.04.2017 05:12:39] SpyJay_YT: I didn't know you /killed him
[26.04.2017 05:12:43] SpyJay_YT: and
[26.04.2017 05:12:51] SpyJay_YT: I was reffering to when I put a bet down
[26.04.2017 05:13:09] SpyJay_YT: I didn't mean anything by it, I just said it wasn't official
[26.04.2017 05:13:14] SpyJay_YT: thats why i didnt win money
[26.04.2017 05:13:17] SpyJay_YT: thats all I was saying
[26.04.2017 05:13:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: i know, but my point is you didnt even notice the chat that said "god_doesnt_exist exploded the body of aldrin"
[26.04.2017 05:13:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: so idk how good of a ref u can really be
[26.04.2017 05:14:04] God_Doesnt_Exist: like the fight was like 5 seconds long and u somehow didnt notice
[26.04.2017 05:14:07] SpyJay_YT: Me not knowing how someone died, doesn't really have anything to do with it
[26.04.2017 05:14:20] SpyJay_YT: You're staff, with all perms
[26.04.2017 05:14:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: yeah it does when it literalyl says it right next to who won and how they won
[26.04.2017 05:14:22] SpyJay_YT: normally
[26.04.2017 05:14:29] SpyJay_YT: a fight can only end by fist
[26.04.2017 05:14:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: u can see the same death messages i do
[26.04.2017 05:14:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: obviously not
[26.04.2017 05:14:37] God_Doesnt_Exist: i /killed him
[26.04.2017 05:14:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: ppl can also try to escape and they die
[26.04.2017 05:14:48] God_Doesnt_Exist: so u dont even know all the rules
[26.04.2017 05:14:57] SpyJay_YT: I said normally..
[26.04.2017 05:15:00] SpyJay_YT: not always
[26.04.2017 05:15:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: so what are you getting it?
[26.04.2017 05:15:16] God_Doesnt_Exist: at*
[26.04.2017 05:15:24] SpyJay_YT: What I'm saying is
[26.04.2017 05:16:03] SpyJay_YT: I mainly didn't notice it because I'm used to ppl being killed by fist, even escape deaths rarely happened, it's normal for me to not realize a different death
[26.04.2017 05:16:35] God_Doesnt_Exist: if its normal for you not realize different deaths, then i have to decline you as ref as i need a ref who that's not normal for
[26.04.2017 05:17:17] SpyJay_YT: I don't understand how me seeing how a person dies is so important dude
[26.04.2017 05:17:26] SpyJay_YT: I'm simply wanted to let people earn money when you're too busy
[26.04.2017 05:17:36] God_Doesnt_Exist: people can earn money while im busy
[26.04.2017 05:17:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats what serverwork and money room is for
[26.04.2017 05:17:43] SpyJay_YT: in fights
[26.04.2017 05:17:52] SpyJay_YT: enjoying themselves
[26.04.2017 05:18:08] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes but as i said, its too easy to abuse and the only person i trust is xsparkz
[26.04.2017 05:18:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: plus i play quite often, thers plenty of official fights
[26.04.2017 05:18:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: plus i play quite often, thers plenty of official fights
[26.04.2017 05:18:30] SpyJay_YT: I seriously don't know how this became a federal case
[26.04.2017 05:18:33] SpyJay_YT: How about this:
[26.04.2017 05:18:56] SpyJay_YT: I get the ability to host offical fights, and if I don't do well, it gets taken away, no questions asked.
[26.04.2017 05:19:02] SpyJay_YT: only 1 chance
[26.04.2017 05:19:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: no because its too hard to track abuse
[26.04.2017 05:19:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: thers no good way to track it
[26.04.2017 05:19:37] SpyJay_YT: but you're on often
[26.04.2017 05:19:38] SpyJay_YT: :L
[26.04.2017 05:19:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: if thats your argument then we dont need another ref
[26.04.2017 05:20:22] SpyJay_YT: :L
[26.04.2017 05:20:28] SpyJay_YT: Can I please have one chance
[26.04.2017 05:20:40] SpyJay_YT: We go way back, you should be able to trust my word.
[26.04.2017 05:20:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: what do you mean we go way back?
[26.04.2017 05:20:59] SpyJay_YT: I've played this server for a while
[26.04.2017 05:20:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: i think you've only been playing here like a year
[26.04.2017 05:21:09] SpyJay_YT: eh, year and a half
[26.04.2017 05:21:24] SpyJay_YT: This might be a 6 year old server
[26.04.2017 05:21:27] SpyJay_YT: but
[26.04.2017 05:21:37] SpyJay_YT: That's pretty long in my world
[26.04.2017 05:22:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: if i were to give it to you
[26.04.2017 05:22:47] God_Doesnt_Exist: i can tell you what would happen
[26.04.2017 05:22:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: it would go good for like a day or two
[26.04.2017 05:23:01] God_Doesnt_Exist: then you're going to make a bad call
[26.04.2017 05:23:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: it'll get removed
[26.04.2017 05:23:09] God_Doesnt_Exist: and you will get angry
[26.04.2017 05:23:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: and you will say "you were just looking for any reason to take it away"
[26.04.2017 05:23:25] God_Doesnt_Exist: and i won't be able to deny that claim
[26.04.2017 05:23:28] SpyJay_YT: Then give me a chance to prove it wrong
[26.04.2017 05:23:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: you read what i said?
[26.04.2017 05:23:58] SpyJay_YT: I honestly don't see how I can make a bad call
[26.04.2017 05:24:11] SpyJay_YT: Here's the way I think of it Gde
[26.04.2017 05:24:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is something like calling it official when someone tries to escape
[26.04.2017 05:24:41] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is calling it official when someone is afk
[26.04.2017 05:24:45] SpyJay_YT: I think of it has being able to host fights that money are won from, you're putting the ideas in my head by saying why not.
[26.04.2017 05:24:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is calling it when someone is partially afk
[26.04.2017 05:25:15] SpyJay_YT: Gde I can't make it offical if the battle started already tho?
[26.04.2017 05:25:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: a bad call is when someone has a technical issue
[26.04.2017 05:25:28] God_Doesnt_Exist: right it can only be called after
[26.04.2017 05:25:47] SpyJay_YT: Gde, I won't do that
[26.04.2017 05:25:49] SpyJay_YT: I promise
[26.04.2017 05:26:26] SpyJay_YT: If I see that both competitors are ready, no one afk or holding still odly, I'll make it offical,
[26.04.2017 05:26:29] SpyJay_YT: but
[26.04.2017 05:26:41] SpyJay_YT: if they just pause in the middle of a fight
[26.04.2017 05:26:45] SpyJay_YT: I can't control that
[26.04.2017 05:27:05] God_Doesnt_Exist: im not asking you to control that
[26.04.2017 05:27:11] SpyJay_YT: Ik
[26.04.2017 05:27:13] SpyJay_YT: Im js
[26.04.2017 05:27:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: it has nothing to do with controlling that idk why you even brought that up
[26.04.2017 05:27:16] SpyJay_YT: incase it happens
[26.04.2017 05:27:26] SpyJay_YT: I was js
[26.04.2017 05:27:40] SpyJay_YT: Gde, I won't let you down.
[26.04.2017 05:28:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: alright i MAY allow it
[26.04.2017 05:28:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: ask me again tomorrow
[26.04.2017 05:28:33] God_Doesnt_Exist: im not convinced yet
[26.04.2017 05:28:42] SpyJay_YT: Ok
[26.04.2017 05:28:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: but your argument is favorable
[26.04.2017 05:28:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: so ask me tomorrow

[26.04.2017 05:30:00] SpyJay_YT: is it favorable
[26.04.2017 05:30:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: the words
[26.04.2017 05:30:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: are
[26.04.2017 05:31:13] SpyJay_YT: hmm
[26.04.2017 05:31:19] SpyJay_YT: I kinda understand now
[26.04.2017 05:31:21] SpyJay_YT: ok
[26.04.2017 05:31:32] SpyJay_YT: Like
[26.04.2017 05:31:39] SpyJay_YT: It's showing
[26.04.2017 05:31:48] SpyJay_YT: worthiness? or should be approved
[26.04.2017 05:31:57] God_Doesnt_Exist: yes you could define it as such
[26.04.2017 05:32:51] God_Doesnt_Exist: so yeah thats the gist
[26.04.2017 05:32:53] God_Doesnt_Exist: ask me tomorrow
[26.04.2017 05:32:56] SpyJay_YT: Ok
[26.04.2017 05:32:57] SpyJay_YT: gn

[27.04.2017 01:27:34] _Vigilance_: Wait, God_Doesnt_Exist, what if you had a police force, and a main gang? The gang would be the opposite of the police force, they would all be evil n shit and spread crime, so there would be 2 opposite forces, sparking RP
[27.04.2017 01:27:35] Razara_Cheshire: don't you give me that dumb excuse. I don't believe it for a second

[27.04.2017 01:39:56] Razara_Cheshire: How would you like it if we took your stuff and used it to destroy your base for no reason?
[27.04.2017 01:40:01] Waggity: 4 stacks of gold
[27.04.2017 01:40:02] _Vigilance_: So God_Doesnt_Exist, how about that Good/Bad idea?
[27.04.2017 01:40:03] God_Doesnt_Exist: raz

[27.04.2017 01:42:00] Razara_Cheshire: Why couldn't you have just destroyed Tony and leave my faction alone?
[27.04.2017 01:42:04] _Vigilance_: What should our fac name be?
[27.04.2017 01:42:05] Waggity: Im not a Bad guy or a Good guy

[27.04.2017 01:42:43] Archieous: They can remain neutral
[27.04.2017 01:42:45] Archieous: Undecided
[27.04.2017 01:42:47] _Vigilance_: They chose to be a mortal and be safe from murder

[27.04.2017 01:43:12] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:15] God_Doesnt_Exist: with anyone?
[27.04.2017 01:43:16] Archieous: Undecided people could buy guns
[27.04.2017 01:43:19] HerpaDerp10000: thats a bad idea
[27.04.2017 01:43:23] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:23] HerpaDerp10000: its dumb
[27.04.2017 01:43:25] _Vigilance_: Villains: Kill Heroes | Heroes: Kill Villains | Neutrals: Can't pvp
[27.04.2017 01:43:25] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:27] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:28] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:29] Waggity: Razara is finally catching on
[27.04.2017 01:43:35] _Vigilance_: Villains: Kill Heroes | Heroes: Kill Villains | Neutrals: Can't pvp
[27.04.2017 01:43:38] Razara_Cheshire: I have been saying that
[27.04.2017 01:43:41] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, That's a bad idea. They're just gonna take all the op heroes and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:43:49] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire that already happens
[27.04.2017 01:43:55] Waggity: Ill pvp for sure
[27.04.2017 01:43:59] HerpaDerp10000: that should be a minigame duh
[27.04.2017 01:44:07] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire ppl can already become op and kill everyone
[27.04.2017 01:44:10] Razara_Cheshire: I know. Having a full team of evil people doing it is worse though
[27.04.2017 01:44:11] Waggity: I fight weak heroes
[27.04.2017 01:44:22] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire that can happen any time
[27.04.2017 01:44:22] Waggity: Like that kid "Percy Jackson"
[27.04.2017 01:44:29] Archieous: lol
[27.04.2017 01:44:42] Razara_Cheshire: Having a team of people doing it is worse
[27.04.2017 01:44:45] _Vigilance_: Razara_Cheshire we could take all the ops's and kill everyone as it is right now
[27.04.2017 01:45:12] Razara_Cheshire: I don't care. You destroyed my faction. If you had waited, Tony probably would have been kicked out of it
[27.04.2017 01:45:14] God_Doesnt_Exist: i'm rejecting your idea.
[27.04.2017 01:45:18] Razara_Cheshire: Tony is a dick

[27.04.2017 01:46:14] Razara_Cheshire: Bastards and Selfish Idiots
[27.04.2017 01:46:19] Waggity: Dark Heroes
[27.04.2017 01:46:28] Razara_Cheshire: I like mine better. You're no heroes
[27.04.2017 01:46:41] _Vigilance_: Ben
[27.04.2017 01:46:42] Waggity: We save people
[27.04.2017 01:46:48] _Vigilance_: I have an Axe
[27.04.2017 01:46:59] Archieous: okay
[27.04.2017 01:47:00] Razara_Cheshire: YEAH CERTAINLY SAVED ME WHEN YOU DESTROYED MY BASE AND KILLED ME
[27.04.2017 01:47:05] Waggity: We should name our faction Dark Heroes
[27.04.2017 01:47:09] Waggity: Yup
[27.04.2017 01:47:17] Razara_Cheshire: I hate you
[27.04.2017 01:47:18] Waggity: We saved it from happening later
[27.04.2017 01:47:24] _Vigilance_: Wait, why dont we change the name to: "The Mercenaries"
[27.04.2017 01:47:25] Razara_Cheshire: ...
[27.04.2017 01:47:36] _Vigilance_: We should be The Mercenaries
[27.04.2017 01:47:44] Waggity: Yeah
[27.04.2017 01:47:45] _Vigilance_: Because we're neutral
[27.04.2017 01:47:54] Waggity: Nice
[27.04.2017 01:48:00] _Vigilance_: we will fight if paid, and we do what we want
[27.04.2017 01:48:07] _Vigilance_: Perfect name
[27.04.2017 01:48:08] Archieous: Now we make power faster
[27.04.2017 01:48:09] Waggity: Nice
[27.04.2017 01:48:10] Razara_Cheshire: GDE, how many plots do you think it'll take to replicate a base like that?
[27.04.2017 01:48:28] Waggity: Lets plan our next attack
[27.04.2017 01:48:30] God_Doesnt_Exist: plots?
[27.04.2017 01:48:30] _Vigilance_: We dont even need a base, we just need one thing... I'll set it up in a sec

[27.04.2017 01:48:48] Razara_Cheshire: If we make it on plots, they literally can't break it
[27.04.2017 01:48:57] Archieous: Your base was 8 chucks
[27.04.2017 01:49:05] Archieous: But we took away 3
[27.04.2017 01:49:12] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats true powergirl you should be able to do it in 2 plots
[27.04.2017 01:49:23] God_Doesnt_Exist: 4 would look the best tho
[27.04.2017 01:49:25] Razara_Cheshire: Thanks. I'll mail Camull about it

[27.04.2017 04:41:45] Bitslane: what does rooting do?
[27.04.2017 04:41:50] _Vigilance_: My friend has hacked games with his rooted tablet :P
[27.04.2017 04:41:59] God_Doesnt_Exist: rooting unlocks ur phone so itsnot locked down by the manufacturer
[27.04.2017 04:42:07] God_Doesnt_Exist: like theres apps and shit on ur phone u cant uninstall
[27.04.2017 04:42:12] Bitslane: oh okay
[27.04.2017 04:42:13] _Vigilance_: Idk if I should root my phone
[27.04.2017 04:42:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: but rooting would allow you to delete them
[27.04.2017 04:42:19] God_Doesnt_Exist: to a degree
[27.04.2017 04:42:27] God_Doesnt_Exist: you can also install adblockers
[27.04.2017 04:42:32] _Vigilance_: because it might mess up my mom's parental thing and cause her to flip out
[27.04.2017 04:42:36] Bitslane: just sounds like a waste of time
[27.04.2017 04:42:37] HerpaDerp10000: 1 free in app purchases 2 change the interface 3 more apps 4 modify ur apps boost things and etc
[27.04.2017 04:42:52] _Vigilance_: ;-; I want to root it ;-;

[27.04.2017 04:43:24] _Vigilance_: But it will probably fuck with my mom's parental setup and she'll flip out so I probably cant D:
[27.04.2017 04:43:34] God_Doesnt_Exist: i wouldn't advise it
[27.04.2017 04:43:39] _Vigilance_: Sad D:
[27.04.2017 04:43:49] God_Doesnt_Exist: the reason why i like the nexus 5 is because its the only phone that actually doesnt come locked down
[27.04.2017 04:44:03] Bitslane: I could care less about that
[27.04.2017 04:44:06] God_Doesnt_Exist: ik
[27.04.2017 04:44:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: rooting is pretty worthless, herpa wasn't able to asnwer my questions
[27.04.2017 04:44:44] God_Doesnt_Exist: ppl like to claim its the best thing ever, but its not really that great

[30.04.2017 00:42:42] God_Doesnt_Exist: okay
[30.04.2017 00:42:45] ImUnicornRainbow: Well Ive seen some servers that have more than 800 players, those servers have organized worlds. One world for creative (plots) one world for superheroes (just us xD) and one world for survival, in each world you cant see the chat from the other world.
[30.04.2017 00:42:59] Camulll: harley
[30.04.2017 00:43:01] ImUnicornRainbow: That way the people who join that arent interested in super heroes or creative can focus on another world.
[30.04.2017 00:43:10] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats because those servers are using multiple servers
[30.04.2017 00:43:11] Wolfie35: Camulll
[30.04.2017 00:43:16] Camulll: http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5900/74/16x9/1200.jpg
[30.04.2017 00:43:17] God_Doesnt_Exist: they are using something called bungeecord

[30.04.2017 00:44:22] God_Doesnt_Exist: realistically the most amount of players a single server canhave might be about 200-300 if you get a top of the line server
[30.04.2017 00:44:23] ImUnicornRainbow: gg
[30.04.2017 00:44:25] adambash: gg
[30.04.2017 00:44:29] God_Doesnt_Exist: more than that and u gotta start linking muyltiple servers together

[30.04.2017 00:45:13] SS_HarleyQuinn: God_Doesnt_Exist
[30.04.2017 00:45:21] God_Doesnt_Exist: thats why the big places like hypixel beg for money all the time, cuz they have like 10 or more servers that keep the whole place running
[30.04.2017 00:45:31] SS_HarleyQuinn: God_Doesnt_Exist

[30.04.2017 00:46:08] ImUnicornRainbow: superman what is your ign? its me _WonderBat_. Oh. Angel my other idea is to have more staff positions, ive seen a lot of people leave because either this server is unfair (without rules) or is not organized enough. We should have staff positions like He
