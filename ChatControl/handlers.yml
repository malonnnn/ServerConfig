# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file support creating handlers that are triggered by user-defined rules.
#
# The purpose of a handler is to collect multiple actions,
# and use them when a message is caught by a rule.
# This reduces repetitive code and makes things more human and future proof.
#
# The names are case sensitive.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# All possible values are commented out below as an example. 
# [NOTICE] They are not mandatory to use. You only need to specify the keys that you have usage for.
#
# !! THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE, DO NOT UNCOMMENT IT, SCROLL DOWN FOR HANDLERS THAT ARE IN USE !!
