# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Here you can create your own rules for chat that will apply
# for following aspects of the game: commands, chat, signs, books and items
#
# [NOTICE] Files by default contain examples that you can safely remove or change.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Operators:
# match <regex> (A valid regular expression string to match the message.)
# id <number/string> (Assign an id/name to the rule. Used in messages and handlers. Not mandatory.)
# require perm <permission> [message] (Only execute the rule if the player has specified permission.
#                                      An optional parameter [message] is the no permission message.)
# ignore string <string/regex> (If the message matches given string it will be ignored.)
# ignore event <chat/commands/signs/book|item> (If the rule triggers on specified event it will be ignored.)
# ignore perm <permission> (A permission to bypass the rule.)
# ignore gamemode <survival/creative/adventure/spectator/0/1/2/3> (Gamemodes to be ignored. Separate by | to add multiple gamemodes.)
# ignore usernames (Rule will ignore the names of the players online. Can degrade performance when having over 100 players.)
# ignore chatdisplay <setName> (If chat ignorer is enabled and a rule catches the message, players who ignore the set won't see the message.)
# ignore world <world|anotherWorld> (Worlds the rule will be ineffective on. Separate by | to add multiple worlds.)
# before strip <regex> (A valid regular expression used to strip specified characters before the message is checked.)
# before replace <regex> with <message> (A regular expression used to replace characters with other characters before the message is checked.)
# then replace <replacement|replacement2> (A string that replaces only the part of the checked message that matches the match.)
#                                         (Chosen randomly from the messages divided by |)
# then rewrite <message|message2> (A message that replaces the entire checked message.)
#                                         (Chosen randomly from the messages divided by |)
# then rewritein <world> <message> (A message used to replace the whole checked message in the specified world only. 
#                                   You can use this together with 'rewrite' as a fallback on other worlds. It is possible 
#                                   to add multiple operators in one rule for multiple worlds.)
# then deny (Cancel the player's message from appearing in the chat.)
# then console <command|command2|command3> (Commands to execute as the console. Use {player} to get player name. Divide multiple commands by |)
# then bungeeconsole <command|command2|command3> (Commands sent to be executed on BungeeCord. Divide multiple commands by |)
# then warn <message> (A message that is displayed to the player. TIP: Use | to split message into multiple lines (when \n is not working for you))
# then kick <optionalReason> (If set, the player will be kicked with optional message.)
# then notify <permission> <message> (Send a message to all players with specified permission.)
# then fine <amount> (If plugin Vault is installed - take specified amount of money from the player.)
# then points <set> <amount> (If points system is enabled (in settings.yml), give the player specified amount of points.)
#                            (NOTICE: If you have global warning set, you do not need to specify the <set> if you want to give points to it)
# then sound <bukkitSoundName>, <volume>, <pitch> (Plays a sound to the player. Example: 'then sound ENTITY_ARROW_HIT_PLAYER, 1.0, 0.1')
# then title <title\nsubtitle> (Displays title to the player. Use \n to separate title from subtitle. You do not need to specify subtitle.)
# then actionbar <message> (Displays action bar to the player.)
# then bossbar <color> <style> <secondsToShow> <message> (Displays boss bar to the player. The plugin navigates you if you do know know
#                                                         what colors or styles are supported.)
# dont verbose (Even if you have Verbose enabled the rule will be hidden from appearing in the console.)
# then log (Caught message will be printed in console and saved in rules_log.txt)
# handle as <handler_name> (Launch actions specified in handlers.yml)
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [TIP] The plugin supports regex capturing groups and it is possible to
#       refer to them in other operators with $<number>. TIP: If the $1 is not
#		displaying relevant information, try using $0 instead.
#
# Example: match You are being teleported to (.*)
#          then rewrite You have been moved to $1. Do /spawn to get back.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Variables:
# {message} (The caught message.)
# {permission} (NOTICE: Only in "require permission" operator)
# ..and all the other variables (see the header in variables/javascript.txt file)
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Colors, unicode, and JSON are supported! Read header in settings.yml for help.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# IP filter. 
# (Notice the operator strip which removes specified characters BEFORE the message is checked.)
