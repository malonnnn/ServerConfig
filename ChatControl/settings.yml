# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#           Welcome to the main configuration of ChatControl PRO
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# For support and updates, visit the official site:
#    https://spigotmc.org/resources/10258
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1) COLOR CODES are supported with the '&' character, see
#    http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Formatting_codes
#    When you use them, omit the message with " " or ' '.
#
# 2) TO HIDE a message, set it to 'none'.
#
# 3) SPECIAL CHARACTERS (Unicode) require the file to be saved in UTF-8
#    encoding. Tested on Notepad++ (UTF-8 without BOM). WordPad on Windows is broken!
#
# 4) JSON is supported. To use it, prepend the message with '[JSON]'.
#    NB: Use either a) quotes, b) write the JSON on a new line
#        or c) send a tellraw command in rules:
#
#    a) Warn_Message: '[JSON] {"text": "Hello World"}'
#
#    b) Example_Message: |-
#       [JSON]
#       {"text": "Hover Me","hoverEvent": {"action": "show_text","value": {"text": "Hey there!"}}}
#
#    c) then console tellraw {"text": "Hello world!"}
#
# 5) VARIABLES are described in 'variables/javascript.txt' file.
#    We support PlaceholderAPI for a greater amount of variables.
#
# 6) SOUND NAMES had changed as per Minecraft 1.9, see:
#    New names: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html
#    Old names: https://goo.gl/ArzbZA
#
# PS: The information above applies for all plugin's files in ChatControl folder.
#
# !! Plugin messages (e.g. 'Please wait 2 seconds [...]') are stored in localization.
#    To customize it, create a file 'localization/messages_LOCALE.yml' in plugin's folder.
#    Replace LOCALE with your localization name found down in the 'Locale' key, and restart
#    the server. The file will be filled with all messages and kept in sync on updates.

Chat:

  #
  # [NOTICE] Enabling channels disables chat formatter.
  #
  # [TIP] To automatically put player into certain channel when they join, give them
  #       'chatcontrol.channel.{channel}.autojoin' permission (replace {channel} with the channel name)
  #       NB: Player can only join one channel at once! If you have multiple permissions,
  #           the first found will be applied and the others ignored.
  #
  # [TIP 2] To automatically make player spy a channel when they join, give them
  #         'chatcontrol.channel.{channel}.autospy' permission (replace {channel} with the channel name)
  #         PS: You can specify multiple channels to spy.
