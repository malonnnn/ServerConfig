    Elements:
      LearnMore: 'Learn more: '
      Air: |-
        Air is the element of freedom. Airbenders are natural pacifists and great explorers. There is nothing stopping them from scaling the tallest of mountains and walls easily. They specialize in redirection, from blasting things away with gusts of winds, to forming a shield around them to prevent damage. Easy to get across flat terrains, such as oceans, there is practically no terrain off limits to Airbenders. They lack much raw damage output, but make up for it with with their ridiculous amounts of utility and speed.
        Airbenders can chain their abilities into combos, type /b help AirCombos for more information.
      Water: |-
        Water is the element of change. Waterbending focuses on using your opponents own force against them. Using redirection and various dodging tactics, you can be made practically untouchable by an opponent. Waterbending provides agility, along with strong offensive skills while in or near water.
        Waterbenders can chain their abilities into combos, type /b help WaterCombos for more information.
      Earth: Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders share many of the same
        fundamental techniques as Waterbenders, but their domain is quite different
        and more readily accessible. Earthbenders dominate the ground and subterranean,
        having abilities to pull columns of rock straight up from the earth or drill
        their way through the mountain. They can also launch themselves through the
        air using pillars of rock, and will not hurt themselves assuming they land
        on something they can bend. The more skilled Earthbenders can even bend metal.
      Fire: |-
        Fire is the element of power. Firebenders focus on destruction and incineration. Their abilities are pretty straight forward: set things on fire. They do have a bit of utility however, being able to make themselves un-ignitable, extinguish large areas, cook food in their hands, extinguish large areas, small bursts of flight, and then comes the abilities to shoot fire from your hands.
        Firebenders can chain their abilities into combos, type /b help FireCombos for more information.
      Chi: |-
        Chiblockers focus on bare handed combat, utilizing their agility and speed to stop any bender right in their path. Although they lack the ability to bend any of the other elements, they are great in combat, and a serious threat to any bender. Chiblocking was first shown to be used by Ty Lee in Avatar: The Last Airbender, then later by members of the Equalists in The Legend of Korra.
        Chiblockers can chain their abilities into combos, type /b help ChiCombos for more information.
